<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><i>A Simple Story</i> is one of those books which, for some
reason or other, have failed to come down to us, as they
deserved, along the current of time, but have drifted into
a literary backwater where only the professional critic or the
curious discoverer can find them out. "The iniquity of
oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy;" and nowhere more
blindly than in the republic of letters. If we were to
inquire how it has happened that the true value of Mrs.
Inchbald's achievement has passed out of general recognition,
perhaps the answer to our question would be found
to lie in the extreme difficulty with which the mass of
readers detect and appreciate mere quality in literature.
Their judgment is swayed by a hundred side-considerations
which have nothing to do with art, but happen easily
to impress the imagination, or to fit in with the fashion of
the hour. The reputation of Mrs. Inchbald's contemporary,
Fanny Burney, is a case in point. Every one has heard of
Fanny Burney's novels, and <i>Evelina</i> is still widely read. Yet
it is impossible to doubt that, so far as quality alone is concerned,
<i>Evelina</i> deserves to be ranked considerably below
<i>A Simple Story</i>. But its writer was the familiar friend of
the greatest spirits of her age; she was the author of one
of the best of diaries; and her work was immediately and
immensely popular. Thus it has happened that the name
of Fanny Burney has maintained its place upon the roll of
English novelists, while that of Mrs. Inchbald is forgotten.</p>

<p>But the obscurity of Mrs. Inchbald's career has not, of
course, been the only reason for the neglect of her work.
The merits of <i>A Simple Story</i> are of a kind peculiarly
calculated to escape the notice of a generation of readers
brought up on the fiction of the nineteenth century. That
fiction, infinitely various as it is, possesses at least one
characteristic common to the whole of it&mdash;a breadth of
outlook upon life, which can be paralleled by no other
body of literature in the world save that of the Elizabethans.
But the comprehensiveness of view shared by Dickens and
Tolstoy, by Balzac and George Eliot, finds no place in
Mrs. Inchbald's work. Compared with <i>A Simple Story</i> even
the narrow canvases of Jane Austen seem spacious pictures
of diversified life. Mrs. Inchbald's novel is not concerned
with the world at large, or with any section of society, hardly
even with the family; its subject is a group of two or three
individuals whose interaction forms the whole business of
the book. There is no local colour in it, no complexity of
detail nor violence of contrast; the atmosphere is vague
and neutral, the action passes among ill-defined sitting-rooms,
and the most poignant scene in the story takes place
upon a staircase which has never been described. Thus
the reader of modern novels is inevitably struck, in <i>A
Simple Story</i>, by a sense of emptiness and thinness, which
may well blind him to high intrinsic merits. The spirit of
the eighteenth century is certainly present in the book, but it
is the eighteenth century of France rather than of England.
Mrs. Inchbald no doubt owed much to Richardson; her view
of life is the indoor sentimental view of the great author of
<i>Clarissa</i>; but her treatment of it has very little in common
with his method of microscopic analysis and vast accumulation.
If she belongs to any school, it is among the followers
of the French classical tradition that she must be placed.
<i>A Simple Story</i> is, in its small way, a descendant of the
Tragedies of Racine; and Miss Milner may claim relationship
with Madame de Cl&egrave;ves.</p>

<p>Besides her narrowness of vision, Mrs. Inchbald possesses
another quality, no less characteristic of her French predecessors,
and no less rare among the novelists of England.
She is essentially a stylist&mdash;a writer whose whole conception
of her art is dominated by stylistic intention. Her style, it
is true, is on the whole poor; it is often heavy and pompous,
sometimes clumsy and indistinct; compared with the style
of such a master as Thackeray it sinks at once into insignificance.
But the interest of her style does not lie in its
intrinsic merit so much as in the use to which she puts it.
Thackeray's style is mere ornament, existing independently
of what he has to say; Mrs. Inchbald's is part and parcel
of her matter. The result is that when, in moments of
inspiration, she rises to the height of her opportunity, when,
mastering her material, she invests her expression with the
whole intensity of her feeling and her thought, then she
achieves effects of the rarest beauty&mdash;effects of a kind for
which one may search through Thackeray in vain. The
most triumphant of these passages is the scene on the staircase
of Elmwood House&mdash;a passage which would be spoilt by
quotation and which no one who has ever read it could
forget. But the same quality is to be found throughout
her work. "Oh, Miss Woodley!" exclaims Miss Milner,
forced at last to confess to her friend what she feels towards
Dorriforth, "I love him with all the passion of a mistress,
and with all the tenderness of a wife." No young lady,
even in the eighteenth century, ever gave utterance to
such a sentence as that. It is the sentence, not of a speaker,
but of a writer; and yet, for that very reason, it is delightful,
and comes to us charged with a curious sense of emotion,
which is none the less real for its elaboration. In <i>Nature
and Art</i>, Mrs. Inchbald's second novel, the climax of the
story is told in a series of short paragraphs, which, for
bitterness and concentration of style, are almost reminiscent
of Stendhal:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The jury consulted for a few minutes. The verdict was
"Guilty".</p>

<p>She heard it with composure.</p>

<p>But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head and
rose to pronounce sentence, she started with a kind of convulsive
motion, retreated a step or two back, and, lifting up
her hands with a scream, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, not from <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>The piercing shriek which accompanied these words prevented
their being heard by part of the audience; and those
who heard them thought little of their meaning, more than
that they expressed her fear of dying.</p>

<p>Serene and dignified, as if no such exclamation had been
uttered, William delivered the fatal speech, ending with
"Dead, dead, dead".</p>

<p>She fainted as he closed the period, and was carried back
to prison in a swoon; while he adjourned the court to go to
dinner.</p></div>

<p>Here, no doubt, there is a touch of melodrama; but it is
the melodrama of a rhetorician, and, in that fine "She heard
it with composure", genius has brushed aside the forced and
the obvious, to express, with supreme directness, the anguish
of a soul.</p>

<p>For, in spite of Mrs. Inchbald's artificialities, in spite of
her lack of that kind of realistic description which seems to
modern readers the very blood and breath of a good story,
she has the power of doing what, after all, only a very few
indeed of her fellow craftsmen have ever been able to do&mdash;she
can bring into her pages the living pressure of a human
passion, she can invest, if not with realism, with something
greater than realism&mdash;with the sense of reality itself&mdash;the
pains, the triumphs, and the agitations of the human heart.
"The heart," to use the old-fashioned phrase&mdash;there is
Mrs. Inchbald's empire, there is the sphere of her glory and
her command. Outside of it, her powers are weak and
fluctuating. She has no firm grasp of the masculine elements
in character: she wishes to draw a rough man, Sandford,
and she draws a rude one; she tries her hand at a hero,
Rushbrook, and she turns out a prig. Her humour is not
faulty, but it is exceedingly slight. What an immortal figure
the dim Mrs. Horton would have become in the hands of
Jane Austen! In <i>Nature and Art</i>, her attempts at social
satire are superficial and overstrained. But weaknesses of
this kind&mdash;and it would be easy to prolong the list&mdash;are what
every reader of the following pages will notice without
difficulty, and what no wise one will regard. "Il ne faut
point juger des hommes par ce qu'ils ignorent, mais par ce
qu'ils savent;" and Mrs. Inchbald's knowledge was as profound
as it was limited. Her Miss Milner is an original and
brilliant creation, compact of charm and life. She is a flirt,
and a flirt not only adorable, but worthy of adoration. Did
Mrs. Inchbald take the suggestion of a heroine with imperfections
from the little masterpiece which, on more sides
than one, closely touches her's&mdash;Manon Lescaut? Perhaps;
and yet, if this was so, the borrowing was of the slightest, for
it is only in the fact that she <i>is</i> imperfect that Miss Milner
bears to Manon any resemblance at all. In every other
respect, the English heroine is the precise contrary of the
French one: she is a creature of fiery will, of high bearing,
of noble disposition; and her shortcomings are born, not
of weakness, but of excess of strength. Mrs. Inchbald has
taken this character, she has thrown it under the influence
of a violent and absorbing passion, and, upon that theme,
she has written her delicate, sympathetic, and artificial book.</p>

<p>As one reads it, one cannot but feel that it is, if not directly
and circumstantially, at least in essence, autobiographical.
One finds oneself speculating over the author, wondering
what was her history, and how much of it was Miss Milner's.
Unfortunately the greater part of what we should most like
to know of Mrs. Inchbald's life has vanished beyond recovery.
She wrote her Memoirs, and she burnt them; and who can
tell whether even there we should have found a self-revelation?
Confessions are sometimes curiously discreet, and, in
the case of Mrs. Inchbald, we may be sure that it is only
what was indiscreet that would really be worth the hearing.
Yet her life is not devoid of interest. A brief sketch of it
may be welcome to her readers.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Inchbald was born on the 15th of October, 1753,
at Standingfield, near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> one of
the numerous offspring of John and Mary Simpson. The
Simpsons, who were Roman Catholics, held a moderate
farm in Standingfield, and ranked among the gentry of
the neighbourhood. In Elizabeth's eighth year, her father
died; but the family continued at the farm, the elder
daughters marrying and settling in London, while Elizabeth
grew up into a beautiful and charming girl. One misfortune,
however, interfered with her happiness&mdash;a defect of utterance
which during her early years rendered her speech so
indistinct as to be unintelligible to strangers. She devoted
herself to reading and to dreams of the great world. At
thirteen, she declared she would rather die than live longer
without seeing the world; she longed to go to London; she
longed to go upon the stage. When, in 1770, one of her
brothers became an actor at Norwich, she wrote secretly to
his manager, Mr. Griffith, begging for an engagement.
Mr. Griffith was encouraging, and, though no definite steps
were taken, she was sufficiently charmed with him to write
out his name at length in her diary, with the inscription
"Each dear letter of thy name is harmony." Was Mr. Griffith
the hero of the company as well as its manager? That, at
any rate, was clearly Miss Simpson's opinion; but she soon
had other distractions. In the following year she paid a visit
to her married sisters in London, where she met another
actor, Mr. Inchbald, who seems immediately to have fallen
in love with her, and to have proposed. She remained
cool. "In spite of your eloquent pen," she wrote to him,
with a touch of that sharp and almost bitter sense that was
always hers, "matrimony still appears to me with less charms
than terrors: the bliss arising from it, I doubt not, is superior
to any other&mdash;but best not to be ventured for (in my opinion),
till some little time have proved the emptiness of all other;
which it seldom fails to do." Nevertheless, the correspondence
continued, and, early in 1772, some entries in her diary give
a glimpse of her state of mind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Jan. 22</i>. Saw Mr. Griffith's picture.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 28</i>. Stole it.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 29</i>. Rather disappointed at not receiving a letter
from Mr. Inchbald.</p></div>

<p>A few months later she did the great deed of her life: she
stepped secretly into the Norwich coach, and went to London.
The days that followed were full of hazard and adventure,
but the details of them are uncertain. She was a girl of
eighteen, absolutely alone, and astonishingly attractive&mdash;"tall,"
we are told, "slender, straight, of the purest complexion,
and most beautiful features; her hair of a golden
auburn, her eyes full at once of spirit and sweetness;" and
it was only to be expected that, in such circumstances,
romance and daring would soon give place to discomfort
and alarm. She attempted in vain to obtain a theatrical
engagement; she found herself, more than once, obliged
to shift her lodging; and at last, after ten days of trepidation,
she was reduced to apply for help to her married sisters.
This put an end to her difficulties, but, in spite of her efforts
to avoid notice, her beauty had already attracted attention,
and she had received a letter from a stranger, with whom
she immediately entered into correspondence. She had all
the boldness of innocence, and, in addition, a force of
character which brought her safely through the risks she ran.
While she was still in her solitary lodging, a theatrical
manager, named Dodd, attempted to use his position as
a cover for seduction. She had several interviews with him
alone, and the story goes that, in the last, she snatched up
a basin of hot water and dashed it in his face. But she was
not to go unprotected for long; for within two months of her
arrival in London she had married Mr. Inchbald.</p>

<p>The next twelve years of Mrs. Inchbald's life were passed
amid the rough and tumble of the eighteenth-century stage.
Her husband was thirty-seven when she married him, a
Roman Catholic like herself, and an actor who depended
for his living upon ill-paid and uncertain provincial engagements.
Mrs. Inchbald conquered her infirmity of speech and
threw herself into her husband's profession. She accompanied
him to Bristol, to Scotland, to Liverpool, to Birmingham,
appearing in a great variety of r&ocirc;les, but never
with any very conspicuous success. The record of these
journeys throws an interesting light upon the conditions
of the provincial companies of those days. Mrs. Inchbald
and her companions would set out to walk from one Scotch
town to another; they would think themselves lucky if they
could climb on to a passing cart, to arrive at last, drenched
with rain perhaps, at some wretched hostelry. But this kind
of barbarism did not stand in the way of an almost childish
gaiety. In Yorkshire, we find the Inchbalds, the Siddonses,
and Kemble retiring to the moors, in the intervals of business,
to play blindman's buff or puss in the corner. Such were
the pastimes of Mrs. Siddons before the days of her fame.
No doubt this kind of lightheartedness was the best antidote
to the experience of being "saluted with volleys of potatoes
and broken bottles", as the Siddonses were by the citizens of
Liverpool, for having ventured to appear on their stage
without having ever played before the King. On this
occasion, the audience, according to a letter from Kemble
to Mrs. Inchbald, "extinguished all the lights round the
house; then jumped upon the stage; brushed every lamp
out with their hats; took back their money; left the theatre,
and determined themselves to repeat this till they have
another company." These adventures were diversified by
a journey to Paris, undertaken in the hope that Mr. Inchbald,
who found himself without engagements, might pick up
a livelihood as a painter of miniatures. The scheme came
to nothing, and the Inchbalds eventually went to Hull,
where they returned to their old profession. Here, in 1779,
suddenly and somewhat mysteriously, Mr. Inchbald died.
To his widow the week that followed was one of "grief,
horror, and almost despair"; but soon, with her old pertinacity,
she was back at her work, settling at last in London,
and becoming a member of the Covent Garden company.
Here, for the next five years, she earned for herself a meagre
living, until, quite unexpectedly, deliverance came. In her
moments of leisure she had been trying her hand upon
dramatic composition; she had written some farces, and,
in 1784, one of them, <i>A Mogul Tale</i>, was accepted, acted,
and obtained a great success. This was the turning-point of
her career. She followed up her farce with a series of plays,
either original or adapted, which, almost without exception,
were well received, so that she was soon able to retire from
the stage with a comfortable competence. She had succeeded
in life; she was happy, respected, free.</p>

<p>Mrs. Inchbald's plays are so bad that it is difficult to
believe that they brought her a fortune. But no doubt it
was their faults that made them popular&mdash;their sentimentalities,
their melodramatic absurdities, their strangely false
and high-pitched moral tone. They are written in a jargon
which resembles, if it resembles anything, an execrable prose
translation from very flat French verse. "Ah, Manuel!"
exclaims one of her heroines, "I am now amply punished
by the Marquis for all my cruelty to Duke Cordunna&mdash;he
to whom my father in my infancy betrothed me, and to
whom I willingly pledged my faith, hoping to wed; till
Romono, the Marquis of Romono, came from the field of
glory, and with superior claims of person as of fame, seized
on my heart by force, and perforce made me feel I had never
loved till then." Which is the more surprising&mdash;that actors
could be found to utter such speeches, or that audiences
could be collected to applaud them? Perhaps, for us, the
most memorable fact about Mrs. Inchbald's dramatic work
is that one of her adaptations (from the German of Kotzebue)
was no other than that <i>Lovers' Vows</i> which, as every one
knows, was rehearsed so brilliantly at Ecclesford, the seat
of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, and which,
after all, was <i>not</i> performed at Sir Thomas Bertram's. But
that is an interest <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>; and, from the
temporal point of view, Mrs. Inchbald's plays must be regarded
merely as means&mdash;means towards her own enfranchisement,
and that condition of things which made possible
<i>A Simple Story</i>. That novel had been sketched as early as
1777; but it was not completely written until 1790, and not
published until the following year. A second edition was
printed immediately, and several more followed; the present
reprint is taken from the fourth, published in 1799&mdash;but
with the addition of the characteristic preface, which, after
the second edition, was dropped. The four small volumes
of these early editions, with their large type, their ample
spacing, their charming flavour of antiquity, delicacy, and
rest&mdash;may be met with often enough in secluded corners of
secondhand bookshops, or on some neglected shelf in the
library of a country house. For their own generation, they
represented a distinguished title to fame. Mrs. Inchbald&mdash;to
use the expression of her biographer&mdash;"was ascertained
to be one of the greatest ornaments of her sex." She was
painted by Lawrence, she was eulogized by Miss Edgeworth,
she was complimented by Madame de Stael herself. She
had, indeed, won for herself a position which can hardly be
paralleled among the women of the eighteenth century&mdash;a
position of independence and honour, based upon talent,
and upon talent alone. In 1796 she published <i>Nature and
Art</i>, and ten years later appeared her last work&mdash;a series of
biographical and critical notices prefixed to a large collection
of acting plays. During the greater part of the intervening
period she lived in lodgings in Leicester Square&mdash;or "Leicester
Fields" as the place was still often called&mdash;in a house opposite
that of Sir Joshua Reynolds. The &#339;conomy which she had
learnt in her early days she continued to practise; dressing
with extraordinary plainness, and often going without a fire
in winter; so that she was able, through her self-sacrifice,
to keep from want a large band of poor relatives and friends.
The society she mixed with was various, but, for the most
part, obscure. There were occasional visits from the now
triumphant Mrs. Siddons; there were incessant propositions&mdash;but
alas! they were equivocal&mdash;from Sir Charles Bunbury;
for the rest, she passed her life among actor-managers and
humble playwrights and unremembered medical men. One
of her friends was William Godwin, who described her to
Mrs. Shelley as a "piquante mixture between a lady and
a milkmaid", and who, it is said, suggested part of the plot
of <i>A Simple Story</i>. But she quarreled with him when he
married Mary Wollstonecraft, after whose death she wrote to
him thus&mdash;"With the most sincere sympathy in all you have
suffered&mdash;with the most perfect forgiveness of all you have
said to me, there must nevertheless be an end to our acquaintance
<i>for ever</i>. I respect your prejudices, but I also respect
my own." Far more intimate were her relations with Dr. Gisborne&mdash;a
mysterious figure, with whom, in some tragic
manner that we can only just discern, was enacted her final
romance. His name&mdash;often in company with that of another
physician, Dr. Warren, for whom, too, she had a passionate
affection&mdash;occurs frequently among her papers; and her
diary for December 17, 1794, has this entry:&mdash;"Dr. Gisborne
drank tea here, and staid very late: he talked seriously of
marrying&mdash;but not <i>me</i>." Many years later, one September,
she amused herself by making out a list of all the Septembers
since her marriage, with brief notes as to her state of mind
during each. The list has fortunately survived, and some
of the later entries are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1791. London; after my novel, Simple Story ... very
happy.</li>

<li>1792. London; in Leicester Square ... cheerful, content,
and sometimes rather happy....</li>

<li>1794. Extremely happy, but for poor Debby's death.</li>

<li>1795. My brother George's death, and an intimate
acquaintance with Dr. Gisborne&mdash;not happy....</li>

<li>1797. After an alteration in my teeth, and the death of
Dr. Warren&mdash;yet far from unhappy.</li>

<li>1798. Happy, but for suspicion amounting almost to
certainty of a rapid appearance of age in my
face....</li>

<li>1802. After feeling wholly indifferent about Dr. Gisborne&mdash;very
happy but for ill health, ill looks, &amp;c.</li>

<li>1803. After quitting Leicester Square probably for ever&mdash;after
caring scarce at all or thinking of Dr. Gisborne ... very
happy....</li>

<li>1806.... After the death of Dr. Gisborne, too, often
very unhappy, yet mostly cheerful, and on my
return to London nearly happy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The record, with all its quaintness, produces a curious
impression of stoicism&mdash;of a certain grim acceptance of the
facts of life. It would have been a pleasure, certainly, but
an alarming pleasure, to have known Mrs. Inchbald.</p>

<p>In the early years of the century, she gradually withdrew
from London, establishing herself in suburban boarding-houses,
often among sisters of charity, and devoting her
days to the practice of her religion. In her early and middle
life she had been an indifferent Catholic: "Sunday. Rose
late, dressed, and read in the Bible about David, &amp;c."&mdash;this
is one of the very few references in her diary to anything
approaching a religious observance during many years. But,
in her old age, her views changed; her devotions increased
with her retirement; and her retirement was at last complete.
She died, in an obscure Kensington boarding-house,
on August 1, 1821. She was buried in Kensington churchyard.
But, if her ghost lingers anywhere, it is not in Kensington:
it is in the heart of the London that she had always
loved. Yet, even there, how much now would she find to
recognize? Mrs. Inchbald's world has passed away from us
for ever; and, as we walk there to-day amid the press of the
living, it is hard to believe that she too was familiar with
Leicester Square.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>It is said, <i>a book should be read with the same spirit with
which it has been written</i>. In that case, fatal must be the
reception of this&mdash;for the writer frankly avows, that during
the time she has been writing it, she has suffered every
quality and degree of weariness and lassitude, into which no
other employment could have betrayed her.</p>

<p>It has been the destiny of the writer of this Story to be
occupied throughout her life, in what has the least suited
either her inclination or capacity&mdash;with an invincible impediment
in her speech, it was her lot for thirteen years to
gain a subsistence by public speaking&mdash;and, with the utmost
detestation to the fatigue of inventing, a constitution suffering
under a sedentary life, and an education confined to the
narrow boundaries prescribed her sex, it has been her fate
to devote a tedious seven years to the unremitting labour of
literary productions&mdash;whilst a taste for authors of the first
rank has been an additional punishment, forbidding her
one moment of those self-approving reflections, which are
assuredly due to the industrious. But, alas! in the exercise
of the arts, industry scarce bears the name of merit. What
then is to be substituted in the place of genius? GOOD
FORTUNE. And if these volumes should be attended by
the good fortune that has accompanied her other writings,
to that divinity, and that alone, she shall attribute their
success.</p>

<p>Yet, there is a <i>first cause</i> still, to whom I cannot here
forbear to mention my obligations.</p>

<p>The Muses, I trust, will pardon me, that to them I do not
feel myself obliged&mdash;for, in justice to their heavenly inspirations,
I believe they have never yet favoured me with one
visitation; but sent in their disguise NECESSITY, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
being the mother of Invention, gave me all mine&mdash;while
FORTUNE kindly smiled, and was accessory to the cheat.</p>

<p>But this important secret I long wished, and endeavoured
to conceal; yet one unlucky moment candidly, though
unwittingly, divulged it&mdash;I frankly owned, "That Fortune
having chased away Necessity, there remained no other
incitement to stimulate me to a labour I abhorred." It
happened to be in the power of the person to whom I confided
this secret, to send NECESSITY once more. Once more,
then, bowing to its empire, I submit to the task it enjoins.</p>

<p>This case has something similar to a theatrical anecdote
told (I think) by Colly Cibber:</p>

<p>"A performer of a very mean salary, played the Apothecary
in Romeo and Juliet so exactly to the satisfaction of the
audience, that this little part, independent of the other
characters, drew immense houses whenever the play was
performed. The manager in consequence, thought it but
justice to advance the actor's salary; on which the poor
man (who, like the character he represented, had been half
starved before) began to live so comfortably, he became too
plump for the part; and being of no importance in any
thing else, the manager of course now wholly discharged
him&mdash;and thus, actually reducing him to the want of a piece
of bread, in a short time he became a proper figure for the
part again."</p>

<p>Welcome, then, thou all-powerful principle, NECESSITY!
THOU, who art the instigator of so many bad authors and
actors&mdash;THOU, who from my infancy seldom hast forsaken
me, still abide with me. I will not complain of any hardship
thy commands require, so thou dost not urge my pen to
prostitution. In all thy rigour, oh! do not force my toil to
libels&mdash;or what is equally pernicious&mdash;panegyric on the unworthy!</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Dorriforth, bred at St. Omer's in all the scholastic
rigour of that college, was, by education, and the solemn
vows of his order, a Roman Catholic priest&mdash;but nicely discriminating
between the philosophical and the superstitious
part of that character, and adopting the former only, he
possessed qualities not unworthy the first professors of
Christianity. Every virtue which it was his vocation to
preach, it was his care to practise; nor was he in the class
of those of the religious, who, by secluding themselves from
the world, fly the merit they might have in reforming mankind.
He refused to shelter himself from the temptations
of the layman by the walls of a cloister, but sought for, and
found that shelter in the centre of London, where he dwelt,
in his own prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.</p>

<p>He was about thirty, and had lived in the metropolis near
five years, when a gentleman above his own age, but with
whom he had from his youth contracted a most sincere
friendship, died, and left him the sole guardian of his daughter,
who was then eighteen.</p>

<p>The deceased Mr. Milner, on his approaching dissolution,
perfectly sensible of his state, thus reasoned with himself
before he made the nomination:&mdash;"I have formed no
intimate friendship during my whole life, except one&mdash;I can
be said to know the heart of no man, except the heart of
Dorriforth. After knowing his, I never sought acquaintance
with another&mdash;I did not wish to lessen the exalted estimation
of human nature which he had inspired. In this moment of
trembling apprehension for every thought which darts across
my mind, and more for every action which I must soon be
called to answer for; all worldly views here thrown aside,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
I act as if that tribunal, before which I every moment expect
to appear, were now sitting in judgment upon my purpose.
The care of an only child is the great charge that in this
tremendous crisis I have to execute. These earthly affections
that bind me to her by custom, sympathy, or what I fondly
call parental love, would direct me to study her present
happiness, and leave her to the care of those whom she thinks
her dearest friends; but they are friends only in the sunshine
of fortune; in the cold nipping frost of disappointment,
sickness, or connubial strife, they will forsake the house of
care, although the very house which they may have themselves
built."</p>

<p>Here the excruciating anguish of the father, overcame
that of the dying man.</p>

<p>"In the moment of desertion," continued he, "which I
now picture to myself, where will my child find comfort?
That heavenly aid which religion gives, and which now,
amidst these agonizing tortures, cheers with humbler hope
my afflicted soul; that, she will be denied."</p>

<p>It is in this place proper to remark, that Mr. Milner was
a member of the church of Rome, but on his marriage with
a lady of Protestant tenets, they mutually agreed their sons
should be educated in the religious opinion of their father,
and their daughters in that of their mother. One child only
was the result of their union, the child whose future welfare
now occupied the anxious thoughts of her expiring father.
From him the care of her education had been with-held, as
he kept inviolate his promise to her departed mother on the
article of religion, and therefore consigned his daughter to
a boarding-school for Protestants, whence she returned with
merely such ideas of religion as ladies of fashion at her age
mostly imbibe. Her little heart employed in all the endless
pursuits of personal accomplishments, had left her mind
without one ornament, except such as nature gave; and
even they were not wholly preserved from the ravages made
by its rival, <i>Art</i>.</p>

<p>While her father was in health he beheld, with extreme
delight, his accomplished daughter, without one fault which
taste or elegance could have imputed to her; nor ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
enquired what might be her other failings. But, cast on
a bed of sickness, and upon the point of leaving her to her
fate, those failings at once rushed on his thought&mdash;and all the
pride, the fond enjoyment he had taken in beholding her
open the ball, or delight her hearers with her wit, escaped
his remembrance; or, not escaping it, were lamented with
a sigh of compassion, or a contemptuous frown, at such
frivolous qualifications.</p>

<p>"Something essential," said he to himself, "must be considered&mdash;something
to prepare her for an hour like this.
Can I then leave her to the charge of those who themselves
never remember such an hour will come? Dorriforth is the
only person I know, who, uniting the moral virtues to those
of religion, and pious faith to native honour, will protect,
without controlling, instruct, without tyrannizing, comfort,
without flattering; and, perhaps in time, make good by
choice, rather than by constraint, the dear object of his dying
friend's sole care."</p>

<p>Dorriforth, who came post from London to visit Mr.
Milner in his illness, received a few moments before his
death all his injunctions, and promised to fulfil them. But,
in this last token of his friend's esteem, he still was restrained
from all authority to direct his ward in one religious opinion,
contrary to those her mother had professed, and in which she
herself had been educated.</p>

<p>"Never perplex her mind with an idea that may disturb,
but cannot reform"&mdash;were his latest words; and Dorriforth's
reply gave him entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>Miss Milner was not with her father at this affecting period&mdash;some
delicately nervous friend, with whom she was on
a visit at Bath, thought proper to conceal from her not only
the danger of his death, but even his indisposition, lest it
might alarm a mind she thought too susceptible. This
refined tenderness gave poor Miss Milner the almost insupportable
agony of hearing that her father was no more, even
before she was told he was not in health. In the bitterest
anguish she flew to pay her last duty to his remains, and
performed it with the truest filial love, while Dorriforth,
upon important business, was obliged to return to town.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_II" id="I_CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Dorriforth returned to London heavily afflicted for the
loss of his friend; and yet, perhaps, with his thoughts more
engaged upon the trust which that friend had reposed in
him. He knew the life Miss Milner had been accustomed
to lead; he dreaded the repulses his admonitions might
possibly meet; and feared he had undertaken a task he was
too weak to execute&mdash;the protection of a young woman of
fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. Dorriforth was nearly related to one of our first
Catholic Peers; his income was by no means confined, but
approaching to affluence; yet such was his attention to those
in poverty, and the moderation of his own desires, that he
lived in all the careful plainness of &#339;conomy. His habitation
was in the house of a Mrs. Horton, an elderly gentlewoman,
who had a maiden niece residing with her, not many years
younger than herself. But although Miss Woodley was
thirty-five, and in person exceedingly plain, yet she possessed
such an extreme cheerfulness of temper, and such an inexhaustible
fund of good nature, that she escaped not only
the ridicule, but even the appellation of an old maid.</p>

<p>In this house Dorriforth had lived before the death of
Mr. Horton; nor upon that event had he thought it necessary,
notwithstanding his religious vow of celibacy, to fly the
roof of two such innocent females as Mrs. Horton and her
niece. On their part, they regarded him with all that
respect and reverence which the most religious flock shews
to its pastor; and his friendly society they not only esteemed
a spiritual, but a temporal advantage, as the liberal stipend
he allowed for his apartments and board, enabled them to
continue in the large and commodious house which they had
occupied during the life of Mr. Horton.</p>

<p>Here, upon Mr. Dorriforth's return from his journey,
preparations were made for the reception of his ward; her
father having made it his request that she might, for a time
at least, reside in the same house with her guardian, receive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the same visits, and cultivate the acquaintance of his companions
and friends.</p>

<p>When the will of her father was made known to Miss
Milner, she submitted, without the least reluctance, to all
he had required. Her mind, at that time impressed with the
most poignant sorrow for his loss, made no distinction of
happiness that was to come; and the day was appointed,
with her silent acquiescence, when she was to arrive in London,
and there take up her abode, with all the retinue of a rich
heiress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton was delighted with the addition this acquisition
to her family was likely to make to her annual income,
and style of living. The good-natured Miss Woodley was
overjoyed at the expectation of their new guest, yet she herself
could not tell why&mdash;but the reason was, that her kind
heart wanted a more ample field for its benevolence; and
now her thoughts were all pleasingly employed how she
should render, not only the lady herself, but even all her
attendants, happy in their new situation.</p>

<p>The reflections of Dorriforth were less agreeably engaged&mdash;Cares,
doubts, fears, possessed his mind&mdash;and so forcibly
possessed it, that upon every occasion which offered, he would
inquisitively endeavour to gain intelligence of his ward's
disposition before he saw her; for he was, as yet, a stranger
not only to the real propensities of her mind, but even to
her person; a constant round of visits having prevented his
meeting her at her father's, the very few times he had been
at his house, since her final return from school. The first
person whose opinion he, with all proper reserve, asked concerning
Miss Milner, was Lady Evans, the widow of a Baronet,
who frequently visited at Mrs. Horton's.</p>

<p>But that the reader may be interested in what Dorriforth
says and does, it is necessary to give some description of his
person and manners. His figure was tall and elegant, but
his face, except a pair of dark bright eyes, a set of white
teeth, and a graceful fall in his clerical curls of brown hair,
had not one feature to excite admiration&mdash;yet such a gleam
of sensibility was diffused over each, that many people mistook
his face for handsome, and all were more or less attracted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
by it&mdash;in a word, the charm, that is here meant to be described,
is a <i>countenance</i>&mdash;on <i>his</i> you read the feelings of his
heart&mdash;saw all its inmost workings&mdash;the quick pulses that beat
with hope and fear, or the gentle ones that moved in a more
equal course of patience and resignation. On this countenance
his thoughts were pourtrayed; and as his mind was
enriched with every virtue that could make it valuable, so
was his face adorned with every expression of those virtues&mdash;and
they not only gave a lustre to his aspect, but added
a harmonious sound to all he uttered; it was persuasive, it
was perfect eloquence; whilst in his looks you beheld his
thoughts moving with his lips, and ever coinciding with what
he said.</p>

<p>With one of those interesting looks which revealed the
anxiety of his heart, and yet with that graceful restraint of
all gesticulation, for which he was remarkable, even in his
most anxious concerns, he addressed Lady Evans, who had
called on Mrs. Horton to hear and to request the news of
the day: "Your Ladyship was at Bath last spring&mdash;you
know the young lady to whom I have the honour of being
appointed guardian. Pray,"&mdash;</p>

<p>He was earnestly intent upon asking a question, but was
prevented by the person interrogated.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Dorriforth, do not ask me any thing about
Miss Milner&mdash;when I saw her she was very young: though
indeed that is but three months ago, and she can't be much
older now."</p>

<p>"She is eighteen," answered Dorriforth, colouring with
regret at the doubts which this lady had increased, but not
inspired.</p>

<p>"And she is very beautiful, that I can assure you," said
Lady Evans.</p>

<p>"Which I call no qualification," said Dorriforth, rising
from his chair in evident uneasiness.</p>

<p>"But where there is nothing else, let me tell you, beauty
is something."</p>

<p>"Much worse than nothing, in my opinion," returned
Dorriforth.</p>

<p>"But now, Mr. Dorriforth, do not from what I have said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
frighten yourself, and imagine your ward worse than she
really is&mdash;all I know of her, is merely, that she's young, idle,
indiscreet, and giddy, with half a dozen lovers in her suite;
some coxcombs, others men of gallantry, some single, and
others married."</p>

<p>Dorriforth started. "For the first time of my life," cried
he with a manly sorrow, "I wish I had never known her
father."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Mrs. Horton, who expected every thing to
happen just as she wished, (for neither an excellent education,
the best company, or long experience had been able to
cultivate or brighten this good lady's understanding,) "Nay,"
said she, "I am sure, Mr. Dorriforth, you will soon convert
her from all her evil ways."</p>

<p>"Dear me," returned Lady Evans, "I am sure I never
meant to hint at any thing evil&mdash;and for what I have said,
I will give you up my authors if you please; for they were
not observations of my own; all I do is to mention them
again."</p>

<p>The good-natured Miss Woodley, who sat working at the
window, an humble, but an attentive listener to this discourse,
ventured here to say exactly six words: "Then
don't mention them any more."</p>

<p>"Let us change the subject," said Dorriforth.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," cried Lady Evans; "and I am sure
it will be to the young lady's advantage."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Milner tall or short?" asked Mrs. Horton, still
wishing for farther information.</p>

<p>"Oh, tall enough of all conscience," returned she; "I tell
you again that no fault can be found with her person."</p>

<p>"But if her mind is defective"&mdash;exclaimed Dorriforth,
with a sigh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That may be improved as well as the person," cried
Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," returned Lady Evans, "I never heard
of a pad to make straight an ill-shapen disposition."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Miss Woodley, "good company,
good books, experience, and the misfortunes of others, may
have more power to form the mind to virtue, than"&mdash;&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Woodley was not permitted to proceed, for Lady
Evans rising hastily from her seat, cried, "I must be gone&mdash;I
have an hundred people waiting for me at home&mdash;besides,
were I inclined to hear a sermon, I should desire Mr. Dorriforth
to preach, and not you."</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Hillgrave was announced. "And here is
Mrs. Hillgrave," continued she&mdash;"I believe, Mrs. Hillgrave,
you know Miss Milner, don't you? The young lady who has
lately lost her father."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hillgrave was the wife of a merchant who had met
with severe losses: as soon as the name of Miss Milner was
uttered, she lifted up her hands, and the tears started in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Lady Evans, "I desire you will give
your opinion of her, and I am sorry I cannot stay to hear it."
Saying this, she curtsied and took her leave.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hillgrave had been seated a few minutes,
Mrs. Horton, who loved information equally with the most
inquisitive of her sex, asked the new visitor&mdash;"If she might
be permitted to know, why, at the mention of Miss Milner,
she had seemed so much affected?"</p>

<p>This question exciting the fears of Dorriforth, he turned
anxiously round, attentive to the reply.</p>

<p>"Miss Milner," answered she, "has been my benefactress
and the best I ever had." As she spoke, she took out her
handkerchief and wiped away the tears that ran down
her face.</p>

<p>"How so?" cried Dorriforth eagerly, with his own eyes
moistened with joy, nearly as much as her's were with
gratitude.</p>

<p>"My husband, at the commencement of his distresses,"
replied Mrs. Hillgrave, "owed a sum of money to her father,
and from repeated provocations, Mr. Milner was determined
to seize upon all our effects&mdash;his daughter, however, by her
intercessions, procured us time, in order to discharge the
debt; and when she found <i>that</i> time was insufficient, and
her father no longer to be dissuaded from his intention, she
secretly sold some of her most valuable ornaments to satisfy
his demand, and screen us from its consequences."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorriforth, pleased at this recital, took Mrs. Hillgrave by
the hand, and told her, "she should never want a friend."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Milner tall, or short?" again asked Mrs. Horton,
fearing, from the sudden pause which had ensued, the subject
should be dropped.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Mrs. Hillgrave.</p>

<p>"Is she handsome, or ugly?"</p>

<p>"I really can't tell."</p>

<p>"It is very strange you should not take notice!"</p>

<p>"I did take notice, but I cannot depend upon my own
judgment&mdash;to me she appeared beautiful as an angel; but
perhaps I was deceived by the beauties of her disposition."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>This gentlewoman's visit inspired Mr. Dorriforth with
some confidence in the principles and character of his ward.
The day arrived on which she was to leave her late father's
seat, and fix her abode at Mrs. Horton's; and her guardian,
accompanied by Miss Woodley, went in his carriage to meet
her, and waited at an inn on the road for her reception.</p>

<p>After many a sigh paid to the memory of her father, Miss
Milner, upon the tenth of November, arrived at the place,
half-way on her journey to town, where Dorriforth and
Miss Woodley were expecting her. Besides attendants, she
had with her a gentleman and lady, distant relations of her
mother's, who thought it but a proper testimony of their
civility to attend her part of the way, but who so much
envied her guardian the trust Mr. Milner had reposed in him,
that as soon as they had delivered her safe into his care,
they returned.</p>

<p>When the carriage, which brought Miss Milner, stopped at
the inn gate, and her name was announced to Dorriforth, he
turned pale&mdash;something like a foreboding of disaster trembled
at his heart, and consequently spread a gloom over all his
face. Miss Woodley was even obliged to rouse him from the
dejection into which he was cast, or he would have sunk
beneath it: she was obliged also to be the first to welcome
his lovely charge.&mdash;Lovely beyond description.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>But the natural vivacity, the gaiety which report had given
to Miss Milner, were softened by her recent sorrow to a meek
sadness&mdash;and that haughty display of charms, imputed to her
manners, was changed to a pensive demeanor. The instant
Dorriforth was introduced to her by Miss Woodley as her
"Guardian, and her deceased father's most beloved friend,"
she burst into tears, knelt down to him for a moment, and
promised ever to obey him as her father. He had his handkerchief
to his face at the time, or she would have beheld
the agitation&mdash;the remotest sensations of his heart.</p>

<p>This affecting introduction being over, after some minutes
passed in general conversation, the carriages were again
ordered; and, bidding farewell to the relations who had
accompanied her, Miss Milner, her guardian, and Miss
Woodley departed for town; the two ladies in Miss Milner's
carriage, and Dorriforth in that in which he came.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, as they rode along, made no attempts to
ingratiate herself with Miss Milner; though, perhaps, such
an honour might constitute one of her first wishes&mdash;she
behaved to her but as she constantly behaved to every other
human creature&mdash;that, was sufficient to gain the esteem of a
person possessed of an understanding equal to Miss Milner's&mdash;she
had penetration to discover Miss Woodley's unaffected
worth, and was soon induced to reward it with the warmest
friendship.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>After a night's rest in London, less violently impressed
with the loss of her father, reconciled, if not already attached
to her new acquaintance, her thoughts pleasingly occupied
with the reflection that she was in that gay metropolis&mdash;a
wild and rapturous picture of which her active fancy had
often formed&mdash;Miss Milner waked from a peaceful and
refreshing sleep, with much of that vivacity, and with all
those airy charms, which for a while had yielded their transcendent
power to the weaker influence of her filial sorrow.</p>

<p>Beautiful as she had appeared to Miss Woodley and to
Dorriforth on the preceding day, when she joined them this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
morning at breakfast, re-possessed of her lively elegance and
dignified simplicity, they gazed at her, and at each other
alternately, with astonishment!&mdash;and Mrs. Horton, as she
sat at the head of her tea-table, felt herself but as a menial
servant: such command has beauty if united with sense and
virtue. In Miss Milner it was so united. Yet let not our
over-scrupulous readers be misled, and extend their idea of
her virtue so as to magnify it beyond that which frail mortals
commonly possess; nor must they cavil, if, on a nearer view,
they find it less&mdash;but let them consider, that if she had more
faults than generally belong to others, she had likewise more
temptations.</p>

<p>From her infancy she had been indulged in all her wishes
to the extreme of folly, and started habitually at the unpleasant
voice of control. She was beautiful; she had been
too frequently told the high value of that beauty, and thought
every moment passed in wasteful idleness during which she
was not gaining some new conquest. She had a quick sensibility,
which too frequently discovered itself in the immediate
resentment of injuries or neglect. She had, besides, acquired
the dangerous character of a wit; but to which she had no
real pretensions, although the most discerning critic, hearing
her converse, might fall into this mistake. Her replies had
all the effect of repartee, not because she possessed those
qualities which can properly be called wit, but that what
she said was delivered with an energy, an instantaneous and
powerful conception of the sentiment, joined with a real or
a well-counterfeited simplicity, a quick turn of the eye, and
an arch smile. Her words were but the words of others, and,
like those of others, put into common sentences; but the
delivery made them pass for wit, as grace in an ill-proportioned
figure will often make it pass for symmetry.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;leaving description&mdash;the reader must form a
judgment of her by her actions; by all the round of great
or trivial circumstances that shall be related.</p>

<p>At breakfast, which had just begun at the commencement
of this chapter, the conversation was lively on the part of
Miss Milner, wise on the part of Dorriforth, good on the
part of Miss Woodley, and an endeavour at all three on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
part of Mrs. Horton. The discourse at length drew from
Mr. Dorriforth this observation:</p>

<p>"You have a greater resemblance of your father, Miss
Milner, than I imagined you had from report: I did not
expect to find you so like him."</p>

<p>"Nor did I, Mr. Dorriforth, expect to find you any thing
like what you are."</p>

<p>"No?&mdash;pray what did you expect to find me?"</p>

<p>"I expected to find you an elderly man, and a plain man."</p>

<p>This was spoken in an artless manner, but in a tone which
obviously declared she thought her guardian young and
handsome. He replied, but not without some little embarrassment,
"A plain man you shall find me in all my actions."</p>

<p>"Then your actions are to contradict your appearance."</p>

<p>For in what she said, Miss Milner had the quality peculiar
to wits, of hazarding the thought that first occurs, which
thought, is generally truth. On this, he paid her a compliment
in return.</p>

<p>"You, Miss Milner, I should suppose, must be a very bad
judge of what is plain, and what is not."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Because I am sure you will readily own you do not think
yourself handsome; and allowing that, you instantly want
judgment."</p>

<p>"And I would rather want judgment than beauty," she
replied, "and so I give up the one for the other."</p>

<p>With a serious face, as if proposing a very serious question,
Dorriforth continued, "And you really believe you are not
handsome?"</p>

<p>"I should, if I consulted my own opinion, believe that
I was not; but in some respects I am like Roman Catholics;
I don't believe upon my own understanding, but from what
other people tell me."</p>

<p>"And let this convince you," replied Dorriforth, "that
what we teach is truth; for you find you would be deceived
did you not trust to persons who know better than yourself.
But, my dear Miss Milner, we will talk upon some other topic,
and never resume this again&mdash;we differ in opinion, I dare say,
on one subject only, and this difference I hope will never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
extend itself to any other. Therefore, let not religion be
named between us; for as I have resolved never to persecute
you, in pity be grateful, and do not persecute me."</p>

<p>Miss Milner looked with surprise that any thing so lightly
said, should be so seriously received. The kind Miss Woodley
ejaculated a short prayer to herself, that heaven would forgive
her young friend the involuntary sin of religious ignorance&mdash;while
Mrs. Horton, unperceived, as she imagined, made the
sign of the cross upon her forehead as a guard against the
infectious taint of heretical opinions. This pious ceremony
Miss Milner by chance observed, and now shewed such an
evident propensity to burst into a fit of laughter, that the
good lady of the house could no longer contain her resentment,
but exclaimed, "God forgive you," with a severity
so different from the idea which the words conveyed, that
the object of her anger was, on this, obliged freely to indulge
that impulse which she had in vain been struggling to suppress;
and no longer suffering under the agony of restraint,
she gave way to her humour, and laughed with a liberty so
uncontrolled, that soon left her in the room with none but the
tender-hearted Miss Woodley a witness of her folly.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Woodley," (then cried Miss Milner, after
recovering herself) "I am afraid you will not forgive me."</p>

<p>"No, indeed I will not," returned Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>But how unimportant, how weak, how ineffectual are
<i>words</i> in conversation&mdash;looks and manners alone express&mdash;for
Miss Woodley, with her charitable face and mild accents,
saying she would not forgive, implied only forgiveness&mdash;while
Mrs. Horton, with her enraged voice and aspect, begging
heaven to pardon the offender, palpably said, she thought
her unworthy of all pardon.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Six weeks have now elapsed since Miss Milner has been in
London partaking with delight all its pleasures, while Dorriforth
has been sighing with apprehension, attending to her with
precaution, and praying with zealous fervour for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
safety. Her own and her guardian's acquaintance, and,
added to them, the new friendships (to use the unmeaning
language of the world) which she was continually forming,
crowded so perpetually to the house, that seldom had
Dorriforth even a moment left him from her visits or visitors,
to warn her of her danger:&mdash;yet when a moment offered, he
caught it eagerly&mdash;pressed the necessity of "Time not always
passed in society; of reflection; of reading; of thoughts
for a future state; and of virtues acquired to make old age
supportable." That forcible power of genuine feeling, which
directs the tongue to eloquence, had its effect while she
listened to him, and she sometimes put on the looks and
gesture of assent&mdash;sometimes even spoke the language of
conviction; but this the first call of dissipation would
change to ill-timed raillery, or peevish remonstrance, at being
limited in delights her birth and fortune entitled her to
enjoy.</p>

<p>Among the many visitors who attended at her levees, and
followed her wherever she went, there was one who seemed,
even when absent from her, to share her thoughts. This
was Lord Frederick Lawnly, the younger son of a Duke, and
the avowed favourite of all the most discerning women of
taste.</p>

<p>He was not more than twenty-three; animated, elegant,
extremely handsome, and possessed of every accomplishment
that would captivate a heart less susceptible of love than
Miss Milner's was supposed to be. With these allurements,
no wonder if she took pleasure in his company&mdash;no wonder
if she took pride in having it known that he was among the
number of her devoted admirers. Dorriforth beheld this
growing intimacy with alternate pain and pleasure&mdash;he
wished to see Miss Milner married, to see his charge in the
protection of another, rather than of himself; yet under the
care of a young nobleman, immersed in all the vices of the
town, without one moral excellence, but such as might result
eventually from the influence of the moment&mdash;under such
care he trembled for her happiness&mdash;yet trembled more lest
her heart should be purloined without even the authority of
matrimonial views.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>With sentiments like these, Dorriforth could never disguise
his uneasiness at the sight of Lord Frederick, nor could the
latter help discerning the suspicion of the guardian, and
consequently each was embarrassed in the presence of the
other. Miss Milner observed, but observed with indifference,
the sensations of both&mdash;there was but one passion which
then held a place in her bosom, and that was vanity; vanity
defined into all the species of pride, vain-glory, self-approbation&mdash;an
inordinate desire of admiration, and an immoderate
enjoyment of the art of pleasing, for her own individual
happiness, and not for the happiness of others. Still had
she a heart inclined, and oftentimes affected by tendencies
less unworthy; but those approaches to what was estimable,
were in their first impulse too frequently met and intercepted
by some darling folly.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley (who could easily discover a virtue, although
of the most diminutive kind, and scarce through the magnifying
glass of calumny could ever perceive a fault) was Miss
Milner's inseparable companion at home, and her zealous
advocate with Dorriforth, whenever, during her absence, she
became the subject of discourse. He listened with hope to
the praises of her friend, but saw with despair how little they
were merited. Sometimes he struggled to subdue his anger,
but oftener strove to suppress tears of pity for her hapless
state.</p>

<p>By this time all her acquaintance had given Lord Frederick
to her as a lover; the servants whispered it, and some of the
public prints had even fixed the day of marriage;&mdash;but as no
explanation had taken place on his part, Dorriforth's uneasiness
was increased, and he seriously told his ward, he
thought it would be indispensably prudent in her to entreat
Lord Frederick to discontinue his visits. She smiled with
ridicule at the caution, but finding it repeated, and in
a manner that indicated authority, she promised not only
to make, but to enforce the request. The next time he came
she did so, assuring him it was by her guardian's desire;
"Who, from motives of delicacy, had permitted her to
solicit as a favour, what he could himself make a demand."
Lord Frederick reddened with anger&mdash;he loved Miss Milner;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
but he doubted whether, from the frequent proofs he had
experienced of his own inconstancy, he should continue to
love&mdash;and this interference of her guardian threatened an
explanation or a dismission, before he became thoroughly
acquainted with his own heart.&mdash;Alarmed, confounded, and
provoked, he replied,</p>

<p>"By heaven, I believe Mr. Dorriforth loves you himself,
and it is jealousy that makes him treat me in this
manner."</p>

<p>"For shame, my Lord!" cried Miss Woodley, who was
present, and who trembled with horror at the sacrilegious
idea.</p>

<p>"Nay, shame to him if he is not in love"&mdash;answered his
Lordship, "for who but a savage could behold beauty like
her's without owning its power?"</p>

<p>"Habit," replied Miss Milner, "is every thing&mdash;Mr. Dorriforth
sees and converses with beauty, but from habit he does
not fall in love; as you, my Lord, from habit, so often do."</p>

<p>"Then you believe that love is not in my nature?"</p>

<p>"No more of it, my Lord, than habit could very soon
extinguish."</p>

<p>"But I would not have it extinguished&mdash;I would rather
it should mount to a flame, for I think it a crime to be
insensible of the divine blessings love can bestow."</p>

<p>"Then you indulge the passion to avoid a sin?&mdash;this very
motive deters Mr. Dorriforth from that indulgence."</p>

<p>"It ought to deter him, for the sake of his oaths&mdash;but
monastick vows, like those of marriage, were made to be
broken&mdash;and surely when your guardian looks at you, his
wishes"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are never less pure," she replied eagerly, "than those
which dwell in the bosom of my <i>celestial</i> guardian."</p>

<p>At that instant Dorriforth entered the room. The colour
had mounted into Miss Milner's face from the warmth with
which she had delivered her opinion, and his accidental
entrance at the very moment this praise had been conferred
upon him in his absence, heightened the blush to a deep glow
on every feature&mdash;confusion and earnestness caused even her
lips to tremble and her whole frame to shake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" cried Dorriforth, looking with
concern on her discomposure.</p>

<p>"A compliment paid by herself to you, Sir," replied Lord
Frederick, "has affected your ward in the manner you
have seen."</p>

<p>"As if she blushed at the untruth," said Dorriforth.</p>

<p>"Nay, that is unkind," cried Miss Woodley; "for if you
had been here"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;I would not have said what I did," replied Miss
Milner, "but left him to vindicate himself."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that I can want any vindication? Who
would think it worth their while to slander so unimportant
a person as I am?"</p>

<p>"The man who has the charge of Miss Milner," replied
Lord Frederick, "derives a consequence from her."</p>

<p>"No ill consequence, I hope, my Lord?" said Dorriforth,
with a firmness in his voice, and with an eye so fixed, that
his antagonist hesitated for a moment in want of a reply&mdash;and
Miss Milner softly whispering to him, as her guardian
turned his head, to avoid an argument, he bowed acquiescence.
And then, as if in compliment to her, he changed the subject;&mdash;with
an air of ridicule he cried,</p>

<p>"I wish, Mr. Dorriforth, you would give me absolution of
all my sins, for I confess they are many, and manifold."</p>

<p>"Hold, my Lord," exclaimed Dorriforth, "do not confess
before the ladies, lest, in order to excite their compassion,
you should be tempted to accuse yourself of sins you have
never yet committed."</p>

<p>At this Miss Milner laughed, seemingly so well pleased, that
Lord Frederick, with a sarcastic sneer, repeated,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"From Abelard it came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Eloisa still must love the name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether from an inattention to the quotation, or from
a consciousness it was wholly inapplicable, Dorriforth heard
it without one emotion of shame or of anger&mdash;while Miss
Milner seemed shocked at the implication; her pleasantry
was immediately suppressed, and she threw open the sash
and held her head out at the window, to conceal the embarrassment
these lines had occasioned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The Earl of Elmwood was at that juncture announced&mdash;a
Catholic nobleman, just come of age, and on the eve of
marriage. His visit was to his cousin, Mr. Dorriforth, but
as all ceremonious visits were alike received by Dorriforth,
Miss Milner, and Mrs. Horton's family, in one common
apartment, Lord Elmwood was ushered into this, and of
course directed the conversation to a different subject.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_VI" id="I_CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>With an anxious desire that the affection, or acquaintance,
between Lord Frederick and Miss Milner might be finally
dissolved, her guardian received with infinite satisfaction,
overtures of marriage from Sir Edward Ashton. Sir Edward
was not young or handsome; old or ugly; but immensely
rich, and possessed of qualities that made him worthy of the
happiness to which he aspired. He was the man whom
Dorriforth would have chosen before any other for the
husband of his ward, and his wishes made him sometimes
hope, against his cooler judgment, that Sir Edward would
not be rejected&mdash;he was resolved, at all events, to try the
force of his own power in the strongest recommendation
of him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that dissimilarity of opinion which, in
almost every instance, subsisted between Miss Milner and
her guardian, there was in general the most punctilious
observance of good manners from each towards the other&mdash;on
the part of Dorriforth more especially; for his politeness
would sometimes appear even like the result of a system
which he had marked out for himself, as the only means to
keep his ward restrained within the same limitations. Whenever
he addressed her there was an unusual reserve upon his
countenance, and more than usual gentleness in the tone
of his voice; this appeared the effect of sentiments which her
birth and situation inspired, joined to a studied mode of
respect, best calculated to enforce the same from her. The
wished-for consequence was produced&mdash;for though there was
an instinctive rectitude in the understanding of Miss Milner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that would have taught her, without other instruction, what
manners to observe towards her deputed father; yet, from
some volatile thought, or some quick sense of feeling, which
she had not been accustomed to subdue, she was perpetually
on the verge of treating him with levity; but he would
immediately recall her recollection by a reserve too awful,
and a gentleness too sacred for her to violate. The distinction
which both required, was thus, by his skilful management
alone, preserved.</p>

<p>One morning he took an opportunity, before her and Miss
Woodley, to introduce and press the subject of Sir Edward
Ashton's hopes. He first spoke warmly in his praise, then
plainly said that he believed she possessed the power of
making so deserving a man happy to the summit of his wishes.
A laugh of ridicule was the only answer; but a sudden frown
from Dorriforth having put an end to it, he resumed his
usual politeness, and said,</p>

<p>"I wish you would shew a better taste, than thus pointedly
to disapprove of Sir Edward."</p>

<p>"How, Mr. Dorriforth, can you expect me to give proofs
of a good taste, when Sir Edward, whom you consider with
such high esteem, has given so bad an example of his, in
approving me?"</p>

<p>Dorriforth wished not to flatter her by a compliment she
seemed to have sought for, and for a moment hesitated what
answer to make.</p>

<p>"Reply, Sir, to that question," she said.</p>

<p>"Why then, Madam," returned he, "it is my opinion,
that supposing what your humility has advanced be just, yet
Sir Edward will not suffer by the suggestion; for in cases
where the heart is so immediately concerned, as I believe Sir
Edward's to be, taste, or rather reason, has no power to act."</p>

<p>"You are in the right, Mr. Dorriforth; this is a proper
justification of Sir Edward&mdash;and when I fall in love, I beg
that you will make the same excuse for me."</p>

<p>"Then," said he earnestly, "before your heart is in that
state which I have described, exert your reason."</p>

<p>"I shall," answered she, "and not consent to marry a man
whom I could never love."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unless your heart is already given away, Miss Milner,
what can make you speak with such a degree of certainty?"</p>

<p>He thought on Lord Frederick when he said this, and he
riveted his eyes upon her as if to penetrate her sentiments,
and yet trembled for what he should find there. She
blushed, and her looks would have confirmed her guilty, if
the unembarrassed and free tone of her voice, more than her
words, had not preserved her from that sentence.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "my heart is not given away; and yet
I can venture to declare, Sir Edward will never possess an
atom of it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, for both your sakes, that these are your
sentiments," he replied. "But as your heart is still your own,"
(and he seemed rejoiced to find it was) "permit me to warn
you how you part with a thing so precious&mdash;the dangers, the
sorrows you hazard in bestowing it, are greater than you
may be aware of. The heart once gone, our thoughts, our
actions, are no more our own, than that is." He seemed
<i>forcing</i> himself to utter all this, and yet broke off as if he could
have said much more, if the extreme delicacy of the subject
had not prevented him.</p>

<p>When he left the room, and she heard the door shut after
him, she said, with an inquisitive thoughtfulness, "What can
make good people so skilled in all the weaknesses of the bad?
Mr. Dorriforth, with all those prudent admonitions, appears
rather like a man who has passed his life in the gay world,
experienced all its dangerous allurements, all its repentant
sorrows; than like one who has lived his whole time secluded
in a monastery, or in his own study. Then he speaks with
such exquisite sensibility on the subject of love, that he
commends the very thing which he attempts to depreciate.
I do not think my Lord Frederick would make the passion
appear in more pleasing colours by painting its delights, than
Mr. Dorriforth could in describing its sorrows&mdash;and if he talks
to me frequently in this manner, I shall certainly take pity on
Lord Frederick, for the sake of his adversary's eloquence."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, who heard the conclusion of this speech
with the tenderest concern, cried, "Alas! you then think
seriously of Lord Frederick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose I do, wherefore that <i>alas!</i> Miss Woodley?"</p>

<p>"Because I fear you will never be happy with him."</p>

<p>"That is plainly telling me he will not be happy with me."</p>

<p>"I do not know&mdash;I cannot speak of marriage from experience,"
answered Miss Woodley, "but I think I can guess
what it is."</p>

<p>"Nor can I speak of love from experience," replied Miss
Milner, "but I think I can guess what it is."</p>

<p>"But do not fall in love, my dear," (cried Miss Woodley,
with her accustomed simplicity of heart, as if she had been
asking a favour that depended upon the will of the person
entreated,) "pray do not fall in love without the approbation
of your guardian."</p>

<p>Her young friend smiled at the inefficacious prayer, but
promised to do all she could to oblige her.</p>

<p>Sir Edward, not wholly discouraged by the denial with
which Dorriforth had, with delicacy, acquainted him, still
hoped for a kind reception, and was so often at the house of
Mrs. Horton, that Lord Frederick's jealousy was excited,
and the tortures he suffered in consequence, convinced him,
beyond a doubt, of the sincerity of his affection. Every
time he beheld the object of his passion, (for he still continued
his visits, though not so frequently as heretofore) he
pleaded his cause with such ardour, that Miss Woodley, who
was sometimes present, and ever compassionate, could not
resist wishing him success. He now unequivocally offered
marriage, and entreated that he might lay his proposals
before Mr. Dorriforth, but this was positively forbidden.</p>

<p>Her reluctance he imputed, however, more to the known
partiality of her guardian for the addresses of Sir Edward,
than to any motive which depended upon herself; and to
Mr. Dorriforth he conceived a greater dislike than ever;
believing that through his interposition, in spite of his ward's
attachment, he might yet be deprived of her. But Miss
Milner declared both to him and to her friend, that love had,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
at present, gained no influence over her mind. Yet did the
watchful Miss Woodley oftentimes hear a sigh escape from
her unknown to herself, till she was reminded of it, and then
a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face. This
seeming struggle with her passion, endeared her more than
ever to Miss Woodley, and she would even risk the displeasure
of Dorriforth by her compliance with every new
pursuit that might amuse the time, which else her friend
passed in heaviness of heart.</p>

<p>Balls, plays, incessant company, at length roused her
guardian from that mildness with which he had been accustomed
to treat her. Night after night his sleep had been
disturbed by fears for her when abroad; morning after
morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return.
He therefore gravely said to her one forenoon as he met her
accidentally upon the staircase,</p>

<p>"I hope, Miss Milner, you pass this evening at home?"</p>

<p>Unprepared for the sudden question, she blushed and
replied, "Yes."&mdash;Though she knew she was engaged to a
brilliant assembly, for which her milliner had been consulted
a whole week.</p>

<p>She, however, flattered herself that what she had said
might be excused as a mistake, the lapse of memory, or some
other trifling fault, when he should know the truth. The
truth was earlier divulged than she expected&mdash;for just as
dinner was removed, her footman delivered a message to her
from her milliner concerning a new dress for the evening&mdash;the
<i>present evening</i> particularly marked. Her guardian
looked astonished.</p>

<p>"I thought, Miss Milner, you gave me your word that
you would pass this evening at home?"</p>

<p>"I mistook&mdash;for I had before given my word that I should
pass it abroad."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried he.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; and I believe it is right that I should keep
my first promise; is it not?"</p>

<p>"The promise you gave me then, you do not think of any
consequence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, if you do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And mean, perhaps, to make it of more consequence than
it deserves, by being offended."</p>

<p>"Whether or not, I <i>am</i> offended&mdash;you shall find I am."
And he looked so.</p>

<p>She caught his piercing eyes&mdash;hers were immediately
cast down; and she trembled&mdash;either with shame or with
resentment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton rose from her seat&mdash;moved the decanters and
fruit round the table&mdash;stirred the fire&mdash;and came back to her
seat again, before another word was uttered. Nor had this
good woman's officious labours taken the least from the awkwardness
of the silence, which, as soon as the bustle she had
made was over, returned in its full force.</p>

<p>At last, Miss Milner rising with alacrity, was preparing
to go out of the room, when Dorriforth raised his voice, and
in a tone of authority said,</p>

<p>"Miss Milner, you shall not leave the house this evening."</p>

<p>"Sir!" she exclaimed with a kind of doubt of what she had
heard&mdash;a surprise, which fixed her hand on the door she had
half opened, but which now she shewed herself irresolute
whether to open wide in defiance, or to shut submissively.
Before she could resolve, he rose from his chair, and said,
with a force and warmth she had never heard him use
before,</p>

<p>"I command you to stay at home this evening." And he
walked immediately out of the apartment by another door.</p>

<p>Her hand fell motionless from that which she held&mdash;she
appeared motionless herself&mdash;till Mrs. Horton, "Beseeching
her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received,"
made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley would have said something to comfort her,
but she had caught the infection, and could not utter a word.
It was not from any real cause of grief that she wept; but
there was a magnetic quality in tears, which always attracted
hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton secretly enjoyed this scene, though the real
well meaning of her heart, and ease of her conscience, did
not suffer her to think so. She, however, declared she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"long prognosticated it would come to this;" and she
"only thanked heaven it was no worse."</p>

<p>"What could be worse, Madam?" cried Miss Milner;
"am not I disappointed of the ball?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to go then?" said Mrs. Horton; "I
commend your prudence; and I dare say it is more than
your guardian gives you credit for."</p>

<p>"Do you think I would go," answered Miss Milner, with
an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears, "in contradiction
to his will?"</p>

<p>"It is not the first time, I believe, you have acted contrary
to that, Miss Milner," replied Mrs. Horton, and affected
a tenderness of voice, to soften the harshness of her words.</p>

<p>"If you think so, Madam, I see nothing that should
prevent me now." And she flung out of the room as if she
had resolved to disobey him. This alarmed poor Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>"My dear aunt," she cried to Mrs. Horton, "follow and
prevail upon Miss Milner to give up her design; she means
to be at the ball in opposition to her guardian's will."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mrs. Horton, "I'll not be instrumental in
detering her&mdash;if she does it may be for the best; it may give
Mr. Dorriforth a clearer knowledge what means are proper
to convert her from evil."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Madam, she must be preserved from the evil
of disobedience; and as you tempted, you will be the most
likely to dissuade her. But if you will not, I must endeavour."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was leaving the room to perform this good
work, when Mrs. Horton, in imitation of the example given
her by Dorriforth, cried,</p>

<p>"Niece, I command you not to stir out of this room this
evening."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley obediently sat down&mdash;and though her
thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend, she
never marked by one impertinent word, or by one line of
her face, the restraint she suffered.</p>

<p>At the usual hour, Mr. Dorriforth and his ward were
summoned to tea:&mdash;he entered with a countenance which
evinced the remains of anger; his eye gave testimony of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
absent thoughts; and though he took up a pamphlet affecting
to read, it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held
it in his hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton began to make tea with a mind as intent
upon something else as Dorriforth's&mdash;she longed for the event
of this misunderstanding; and though she wished no ill
to Miss Milner, yet with an inclination bent upon seeing
something new&mdash;without the fatigue of going out of her
own house&mdash;she was not over scrupulous what that novelty
might be. But for fear she should have the imprudence to
speak a word upon the subject which employed her thoughts,
or even to look as if she thought of it at all; she pinched her
lips close together, and cast her eyes on vacancy, lest their
significant regards might expose her to detection. And for
fear any noise should intercept even the sound of what might
happen, she walked across the room more softly than usual,
and more softly touched every thing she was obliged to lay
her hand on.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley thought it her duty to be mute; and now
the gingle of a tea spoon was like a deep-toned bell, all was
so quiet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton, too, in the self-approving reflection that she
was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind, felt herself
at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable. Miss
Woodley did not recollect <i>herself</i> so, but was so in reality&mdash;in
her, peace and charity were instinctive virtues, accident
could not increase them.</p>

<p>The tea had scarce been made, when a servant came with
Miss Milner's compliments, and she "did not mean to have
any tea." The pamphlet shook in Dorriforth's hand while
this message was delivered&mdash;he believed her to be dressing
for her evening's entertainment, and now studied in what
manner he should prevent, or resent her disobedience to his
commands. He coughed&mdash;drank his tea&mdash;endeavoured to
talk, but found it difficult&mdash;sometimes read&mdash;and in this
manner near two hours were passed away, when Miss Milner
came into the room.&mdash;Not dressed for a ball, but as she
had risen from dinner. Dorriforth read on, and seemed
afraid of looking up, lest he should see what he could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
have pardoned. She drew a chair and sat at the table by
the side of her delighted friend.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' pause, and some little embarrassment
on the part of Mrs. Horton, at the disappointment she had
to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct, she
asked Miss Milner, "if she would now have any tea?" She
replied, "No, I thank you, Ma'am," in a voice so languid,
compared with her usual one, that Dorriforth lifted up his
eyes from the book; and seeing her in the same dress that
she had worn all the day, turned them hastily away from her
again&mdash;not with a look of triumph, but of confusion.</p>

<p>Whatever he might have suffered if he had seen her
decorated, and prepared to bid defiance to his commands,
yet even upon that trial, he would not have endured half
the painful sensations he now for a moment felt&mdash;he felt
himself to blame.</p>

<p>He feared that he had treated her with too much severity&mdash;he
admired her condescension, accused himself for having
exacted it&mdash;he longed to ask her pardon&mdash;he did not know
how.</p>

<p>A cheerful reply from her, to a question of Miss Woodley's,
embarrassed him still more&mdash;he wished that she had been
sullen, he then would have had a temptation, or pretence,
to have been sullen too.</p>

<p>With all these sentiments crowding fast upon his heart, he
still read, or seemed to read, as if he took no notice of what
was passing; till a servant came into the room and asked
Miss Milner at what time she should want the carriage? to
which she replied, "I don't go out to-night." Dorriforth
then laid the book out of his hand, and by the time the
servant had left the room, thus began:</p>

<p>"Miss Milner, I give you, I fear, some unkind proofs of
my regard. It is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be
troublesome&mdash;sometimes unmannerly. Forgive the duties
of my office, and believe that no one is half so much
concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness, as I
myself am."</p>

<p>What he said, he looked with so much sincerity, that had
she been burning with rage at his late behaviour, she must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
have forgiven him, for the regret which he so forcibly
exprest. She was going to reply, but found she could not,
without accompanying her words with tears, therefore, after
the first attempt, she desisted.</p>

<p>On this he rose from his chair, and going to her, said,
"Once more shew your submission by obeying me a second
time to-day. Keep your appointment, and be assured that
I shall issue my commands with more circumspection for
the future, as I find how strictly they are complied with."</p>

<p>Miss Milner, the gay, the vain, the dissipated, the haughty
Miss Milner, sunk underneath this kindness, and wept with
a gentleness and patience, which did not give more surprise
than it gave joy to Dorriforth. He was charmed to find her
disposition so tractable&mdash;prophesied to himself the future
success of his guardianship, and her eternal as well as temporal
happiness from this specimen.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_VIII" id="I_CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Although Dorriforth was the good man that he has been
described, there were in his nature shades of evil&mdash;there was
an obstinacy which he himself, and his friends termed firmness
of mind; but had not religion and some opposite
virtues weighed heavily in the balance, it would frequently
have degenerated into implacable stubbornness.</p>

<p>The child of a sister once beloved, who married a young
officer against her brother's consent, was at the age of three
years left an orphan, destitute of all support but from his
uncle's generosity: but though Dorriforth maintained, he
would never see him. Miss Milner, whose heart was a receptacle
for the unfortunate, no sooner was told the melancholy
history of Mr. and Mrs. Rushbrook, the parents of the child,
than she longed to behold the innocent inheritor of her
guardian's resentment, and took Miss Woodley with her to
see the boy. He was at a farm house a few miles from town;
and his extreme beauty and engaging manners, wanted not
the sorrows to which he had been born, to give him farther
recommendation to the kindness of her, who had come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
visit him. She looked at him with admiration and pity, and
having endeared herself to him by the most affectionate
words and caresses, on her bidding him farewell, he cried
most pitiously to go along with her. Unused at any time
to resist temptations, whether to reprehensible, or to laudable
actions, she yielded to his supplications, and having overcome
a few scruples of Miss Woodley's, determined to take young
Rushbrook to town, and present him to his uncle. This
idea was no sooner formed than executed. By making
a present to the nurse, she readily gained her consent to
part with him for a day or two, and the signs of joy denoted
by the child on being put into the carriage, repaid her beforehand
for every reproof she might receive from her guardian,
for the liberty she had taken.</p>

<p>"Besides," said she to Miss Woodley, who had still her
fears, "do you not wish his uncle should have a warmer
interest in his care than duty?&mdash;it is duty alone which induces
Mr. Dorriforth to provide for him; but it is proper that
affection should have some share in his benevolence&mdash;and
how, hereafter, will he be so fit an object of the love which
compassion excites, as he is at present?"</p>

<p>Miss Woodley acquiesced. But before they arrived at
their own door it came into Miss Milner's remembrance,
that there was a grave sternness in the manners of her guardian
when provoked, the recollection of which made her a little
apprehensive for what she had done&mdash;her friend, who knew
him better than she did, was more so. They both became
silent as they approached the street where they lived&mdash;for
Miss Woodley having once represented her fears, and having
suppressed them in resignation to Miss Milner's better judgment,
would not repeat them&mdash;and Miss Milner would not
confess they were now troubling her.</p>

<p>Just, however, as the coach stopped at the door, she had
the forecast and the humility to say, "We will not tell
Mr. Dorriforth the child is his nephew, unless he should
appear fond, and pleased with him, and then I think we
may venture without any danger."</p>

<p>This was agreed; and when Dorriforth entered the room
just before dinner, poor Harry Rushbrook was introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
as the son of a lady who frequently visited there. The
deception passed&mdash;his uncle shook hands with him, and at
length highly pleased with his engaging manner, and applicable
replies, took him on his knee, and kissed him with
affection. Miss Milner could scarce restrain the joy it gave
her; but unluckily, Dorriforth said soon after to the child,
"And now tell me your name."</p>

<p>"Harry Rushbrook," replied he, with force and clearness
of voice.</p>

<p>Dorriforth was holding him fondly round the waist as he
stood with his feet upon his knees; and at this reply he did
not <i>throw</i> him from him&mdash;but he removed his hands, which
had supported him, so suddenly, that the child, to prevent
falling on the floor, threw himself about his uncle's neck.
Miss Milner and Miss Woodley turned aside to conceal their
tears. "I had like to have been down," cried Harry, fearing
no other danger. But his uncle took hold of each hand
which had twined around him, and placed him immediately
on the ground. The dinner being that instant served, he
gave no greater marks of his resentment than calling for his
hat, and walking instantly out of the house.</p>

<p>Miss Milner cried for anger; yet she did not shew less
kindness to the object of this vexatious circumstance: she
held him in her arms while she sat at table, and repeatedly
said to him, (though he had not the sense to thank her)
"That she would always be his friend."</p>

<p>The first emotions of resentment against Dorriforth being
passed, she returned with her little charge to the farm house,
before it was likely his uncle should come back; another
instance of obedience, which Miss Woodley was impatient
her guardian should know; she therefore enquired where
he was, and sent him a note for the sole purpose of acquainting
him with it, offering at the same time an apology for what
had happened. He returned in the evening seemingly
reconciled, nor was a word mentioned of the incident which
had occurred in the former part of the day; yet in his
countenance remained a perfect remembrance of it, without
one trait of compassion for his helpless nephew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_IX" id="I_CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>There are few things so mortifying to a proud spirit as to
suffer by immediate comparison&mdash;men can hardly bear it, but
to women the punishment is intolerable; and Miss Milner
now laboured under this humiliation to a degree which
gave her no small inquietude.</p>

<p>Miss Fenton, young, of exquisite beauty, elegant manners,
gentle disposition, and discreet conduct, was introduced to
Miss Milner's acquaintance by her guardian, and frequently,
sometimes inadvertently, held up by him as a pattern for her
to follow&mdash;for when he did not say this in direct terms, it
was insinuated by the warmth of his panegyric on those
virtues in which Miss Fenton excelled, and in which his ward
was obviously deficient. Conscious of her own inferiority
in these subjects of her guardian's praise, Miss Milner,
instead of being inspired to emulation, was provoked to
envy.</p>

<p>Not to admire Miss Fenton was impossible&mdash;to find one
fault with her person or sentiments was equally impossible&mdash;and
yet to love her was unlikely.</p>

<p>That serenity of mind which kept her features in a continual
placid form, though enchanting at the first glance,
upon a second or third, fatigued the sight for want of variety;
and to have seen her distorted with rage, convulsed with
mirth, or in deep dejection, had been to her advantage. But
her superior soul appeared above those emotions, and there
was more inducement to worship her as a saint than to love
her as a woman. Yet Dorriforth, whose heart was not
formed (at least not educated) for love, regarding her in the
light of friendship only, beheld her as the most perfect model
for her sex. Lord Frederick on first seeing her was struck
with her beauty, and Miss Milner apprehended she had
introduced a rival; but he had not seen her three times,
before he called her "The most insufferable of Heaven's
creatures," and vowed there was more charming variation
in the plain features of Miss Woodley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Milner had a heart affectionate to her own sex, even
where she saw them in possession of superior charms; but
whether from the spirit of contradiction, from feeling herself
more than ordinarily offended by her guardian's praise of
this lady, or that there was a reserve in Miss Fenton that did
not accord with her own frank and ingenuous disposition, so
as to engage her esteem, certain it is that she took infinite
satisfaction in hearing her beauty and virtues depreciated
or turned into ridicule, particularly if Mr. Dorriforth was
present. This was painful to him upon many accounts;
perhaps an anxiety for his ward's conduct was not among the
least; and whenever the circumstance occurred, he could
with difficulty restrain his anger. Miss Fenton was not only
a person whose amiable qualities he admired, but she was
soon to be allied to him by her marriage with his nearest
relation, Lord Elmwood, a young nobleman whom he
sincerely loved.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood had discovered all that beauty in Miss
Fenton which every common observer could not but see.
The charms of her mind and of her fortune had been pointed
out by his tutor; and the utility of the marriage, in perfect
submission to his precepts, he never permitted himself to
question.</p>

<p>This preceptor held with a magisterial power the government
of his pupil's passions; nay, governed them so entirely,
that no one could perceive (nor did the young Lord himself
know) that he had any.</p>

<p>This rigid monitor and friend was a Mr. Sandford, bred
a Jesuit in the same college at which Dorriforth had since
been educated, but before his time the order was compelled
to take another name. Sandford had been the tutor of
Dorriforth as well as of his cousin, Lord Elmwood, and by
this double tie seemed now entailed upon the family. As
a Jesuit, he was consequently a man of learning; possessed
of steadiness to accomplish the end of any design once
meditated, and of sagacity to direct the conduct of men
more powerful, but less ingenious, than himself. The
young Earl, accustomed in his infancy to fear him as his
master, in his youthful manhood received every new indul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>gence
with gratitude, and at length loved him as a
father&mdash;nor had Dorriforth as yet shaken off similar sensations.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandford perfectly knew how to influence the sentiments
and sensations of all human kind, but yet he had the
forbearance not to "draw all hearts towards him." There
were some whose hatred he thought not unworthy of his
pious labours; and in that pursuit he was more rapid in his
success than even in procuring esteem. It was an enterprise
in which he succeeded with Miss Milner even beyond his
most sanguine wish.</p>

<p>She had been educated at an English boarding school, and
had no idea of the superior and subordinate state of characters
in a foreign seminary&mdash;besides, as a woman, she was privileged
to say any thing she pleased; and as a beautiful woman,
she had a right to expect that whatever she pleased to say,
should be admired.</p>

<p>Sandford knew the hearts of women, as well as those of
men, though he had passed little of his time in their society&mdash;he
saw Miss Milner's heart at the first view of her person;
and beholding in that little circumference a weight of folly
that he wished to eradicate, he began to toil in the vineyard,
eagerly courting her detestation of him, in the hope he could
also make her abominate herself. In the mortifications of
slight he was expert; and being a man of talents, whom all
companies, especially her friends, respected, he did not begin
by wasting that reverence so highly valued upon ineffectual
remonstrances, of which he could foresee the reception, but
wakened her attention by his neglect of her. He spoke of
her in her presence as of an indifferent person, sometimes
forgetting even to name her when the subject required it;
then would ask her pardon, and say that he "Really did not
recollect her," with such seeming sorrow for his fault, that
she could not think the offence intended, and of course felt
the affront more acutely.</p>

<p>While, with every other person she was the principle, the
cause upon whom a whole party depended for conversation,
cards, musick, or dancing, with Mr. Sandford she found that
she was of no importance. Sometimes she tried to consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
this disregard of her as merely the effect of ill-breeding;
but he was not an ill-bred man: he was a gentleman by
birth, and one who had kept the best company&mdash;a man of
sense and learning. "And such a man slights me without
knowing it," she said&mdash;for she had not dived so deeply into
the powers of simulation, as to suspect that such careless
manners were the result of art.</p>

<p>This behaviour of Mr. Sandford had its desired effect&mdash;it
humbled her in her own opinion more than a thousand
sermons would have done preached on the vanity of youth
and beauty. She felt an inward shame at the insignificance
of these qualities that she never knew before, and would
have been cured of all her pride, had she not possessed a degree
of spirit beyond the generality of her sex&mdash;such a degree as
even Mr. Sandford, with all his penetration, did not expect.
She determined to resent his treatment; and, entering the
lists as his declared enemy, give to the world a reason why
he did not acknowledge her sovereignty, as well as the rest
of her devoted subjects.</p>

<p>She now commenced hostilities against all his arguments,
his learning, and his favourite axioms; and by a happy talent
of ridicule, in want of other weapons for this warfare, she
threw in the way of the holy Father as great trials of his
patience, as any that his order could have substituted in
penance. Many things he bore like a martyr&mdash;at others, his
fortitude would forsake him, and he would call on her
guardian, his former pupil, to interpose with his authority:
she would then declare that she only had acted thus "to try
the good man's temper, and that if he had combated with
his fretfulness a few moments longer, she would have acknowledged
his claim to canonization; but that having yielded
to the sallies of his anger, he must now go through numerous
other probations."</p>

<p>If Miss Fenton was admired by Dorriforth, by Sandford
she was adored&mdash;and, instead of placing her as an example
to Miss Milner, he spoke of her as of one endowed beyond
Miss Milner's power of imitation. Often, with a shake of
his head and a sigh, would he say,</p>

<p>"No; I am not so hard upon you as your guardian:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
I only desire you to love Miss Fenton; to resemble her,
I believe, is above your ability."</p>

<p>This was too much to bear composedly&mdash;and poor Miss
Woodley, who was generally a witness of these controversies,
felt a degree of sorrow at every sentence which like the foregoing
chagrined and distressed her friend. Yet as she
suffered too for Mr. Sandford, the joy of her friend's reply
was abated by the uneasiness it gave to <i>him</i>. But Mrs. Horton
felt for none but the right reverend priest; and often did
she feel so violently interested in his cause, that she could
not refrain giving an answer herself in his behalf&mdash;thus doing
the duty of an adversary with all the zeal of an advocate.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Mr. Sandford finding his friend Dorriforth frequently
perplexed in the management of his ward, and he himself
thinking her incorrigible, gave his counsel, that a suitable
match should be immediately sought out for her, and the
care of so dangerous a person given into other hands. Dorriforth
acknowledged the propriety of this advice, but lamented
the difficulty of pleasing his ward as to the quality of her
lover; for she had refused, besides Sir Edward Ashton,
many others of equal pretensions. "Depend upon it then,"
cried Sandford, "that her affections are engaged; and it is
proper that you should know to whom." Dorriforth thought
he did know, and mentioned Lord Frederick; but said that
he had no farther authority for the supposition than what his
observation had given him, for that every explanation both
upon his and her side had been evaded. "Take her then,"
cried Sandford, "into the country, and if Lord Frederick
should not follow, there is an end of your suspicions."</p>

<p>"I shall not easily prevail upon Miss Milner to leave town,"
replied he, "while it is in the highest fashion."</p>

<p>"You can
but try," returned Sandford; "and if you should not
succeed now, at least fix the time you mean to go during
the autumn, and be firm to your determination."</p>

<p>"But
in the autumn," replied Dorriforth, "Lord Frederick will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of course be in the country; and as his uncle's estate is near
our residence, he will not then so evidently follow her, as
he would if I could induce her to go now."</p>

<p>It was agreed the attempt should be made. Instead of
receiving this abrupt proposal with uneasiness, Miss Milner,
to the surprise of all present, immediately consented; and
gave her guardian an opportunity of saying several of the
kindest and politest things upon her ready compliance.</p>

<p>"A token of approbation from you, Mr. Dorriforth,"
returned she, "I always considered with high estimation&mdash;but
your commendations are now become infinitely superior
in value by their scarcity; for I do not believe that since
Miss Fenton and Mr. Sandford came to town, I have
received one testimony of your esteem."</p>

<p>Had these words been uttered with pleasantry, they might
have passed without observation; but at the conclusion of
the period, resentment flew to Miss Milner's face, and she
darted a piercing look at Mr. Sandford, which more pointedly
expressed that she was angry with him, than if she had
spoken volumes in her usual strain of raillery. Dorriforth
was confused&mdash;but the concern which she had so plainly
evinced for his good opinion throughout all that she had
been saying, silenced any rebuke he might else have given
her, for this unwarrantable charge against his friend. Mrs.
Horton was shocked at the irreverent manner in which
Mr. Sandford was treated&mdash;and Miss Woodley turned to
him with a benevolent smile upon her face, hoping to set
him an example of the manner in which he should receive the
reproach. Her good wishes did not succeed&mdash;yet he was
perfectly unruffled, and replied with coolness,</p>

<p>"The air of the country has affected the lady already&mdash;but
it is a comfortable thing," continued he, "that in the
variety of humours to which some women are exposed, they
cannot be uniform even in deceit."</p>

<p>"Deceit!" cried Miss Milner, "in what am I deceitful?
did I ever pretend that I had an esteem for you?"</p>

<p>"That would not have been deceit, Madam, but merely
good manners."</p>

<p>"I never, Mr. Sandford, sacrificed truth to politeness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Except when the country has been proposed, and you
thought it politeness to appear satisfied."</p>

<p>"And I <i>was</i> satisfied, till I recollected that you might
probably be of the party&mdash;then, every grove was changed
into a wilderness, every rivulet into a stagnated pool, and
every singing bird into a croaking raven."</p>

<p>"A very poetical description," returned he calmly. "But,
Miss Milner, you need not have had any apprehensions of
<i>my</i> company in the country, for I understand the seat to
which your guardian means to go, belongs to you; and you
may depend upon it, Madam, that I shall never enter a house
in which you are the mistress."</p>

<p>"Nor any house, I am certain, Mr. Sandford, but in which
you are yourself the master."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Madam? (and for the first time he
elevated his voice,) am I the master here?"</p>

<p>"Your servants," replied she, looking at the company,
"will not tell you so; but I do."</p>

<p>"You condescend, Mr. Sandford," cried Mrs. Horton,
"in talking so much to a young heedless woman; but I know
you do it for her good."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Milner," cried Dorriforth, (and the most
cutting thing he could say,) "since I find my proposal of
the country has put you out of humour, I shall mention it
no more."</p>

<p>With all that quantity of resentment, anger, or rage, which
sometimes boiled in the veins of Miss Milner, she was yet
never wanting in that respect towards her guardian, which
with-held her from ever uttering one angry sentence, directed
immediately to him; and a severe word of his, instead of
exasperating, was sure to subdue her. This was the case at
present&mdash;his words wounded her to the heart, but she had
not the asperity to reply to them as she thought they merited,
and she burst into tears. Dorriforth, instead of being concerned,
as he usually was at seeing her uneasy, appeared on
the present occasion provoked. He thought her weeping
was a new reproach to his friend Mr. Sandford, and that to
suffer himself to be moved by it, would be a tacit condemnation
of his friend's conduct. She understood his thoughts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and getting the better of her tears, apologised for her weakness;
adding,</p>

<p>"She could never bear with indifference an unjust accusation."</p>

<p>"To prove that mine was unjust, Madam," replied Dorriforth;
"be prepared to quit London, without any marks of
regret, in a few days."</p>

<p>She bowed assent; the necessary preparations were agreed
upon; and while with apparent satisfaction she adjusted the
plan of her journey, (like those who behave well, not so
much to please themselves as to vex their enemies,) she
secretly triumphed in the mortification she hoped that
Mr. Sandford would receive from her obedient behaviour.</p>

<p>The news of this intended journey was of course soon
made public. There is a secret charm in being pitied, when
the misfortune is but ideal; and Miss Milner found infinite
gratification in being told, "That her's was a cruel case,
and that it was unjust and barbarous to force so much beauty
into concealment while London was filled with her admirers;
who, like her, would languish in consequence of her solitude."
These things, and a thousand such, a thousand times repeated,
she still listened to with pleasure; yet preserved the constancy
not to shrink from her resolution of submitting.</p>

<p>Those involuntary sighs, however, that Miss Woodley had
long ago observed, became still more frequent; and a tear
half starting in her eye was an additional subject of her
friend's observation. Yet though Miss Milner at those times
was softened into melancholy, she by no means appeared
unhappy. Her friend was acquainted with love only by
name; yet she was confirmed from these increased symptoms,
in what she before only suspected, that <i>love</i> must be the
foundation of her care. "Her senses have been captivated
by the person and accomplishments of Lord Frederick," said
Miss Woodley to herself, "but her understanding compels
her to see his faults, and reproaches her passion.&mdash;And, oh!"
cried she, "could her guardian and Mr. Sandford know of
this conflict, how much would they have to admire; how
little to condemn!"</p>

<p>With such friendly thoughts, and with the purest inten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>tions,
Miss Woodley did not fail to give both gentlemen
reason to believe, a contention of this nature was the actual
state of Miss Milner's mind. Dorriforth was affected at the
description, and Sandford urged more than ever the necessity
of leaving town. In a few days they departed; Mrs.
Horton, Miss Woodley, Miss Milner, and Mr. Dorriforth,
accompanied by Miss Fenton, whom Miss Milner, knowing
it to be the wish of her guardian, invited, for three months
before her marriage, to her country seat. Elmwood House,
or rather Castle, the seat of Lord Elmwood, was only a few
miles distant from this residence, and he was expected to pass
great part of the summer there, with his tutor, Mr. Sandford.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood was also (as it has been already said)
an estate belonging to an uncle of Lord Frederick's, and most
of the party suspected they should soon see him on a visit
there. To that expectation they in great measure attributed
Miss Milner's visible content.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_XI" id="I_CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>With this party Miss Milner arrived at her country house,
and for near six weeks, all around was the picture of tranquillity;
her satisfaction was as evident as every other
person's; and all severe admonition being at this time
unnecessary, either to exhort her to her duty, or to warn her
against her folly, she was even in perfect good humour with
Miss Fenton, and added friendship to hospitality.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandford, who came with Lord Elmwood to the neighbouring
seat, about a week after the arrival of Miss Milner
at her's, was so scrupulously exact in the observance of his
word, "<i>Never to enter a house of Miss Milner's,</i>" that he
would not even call upon his friend Dorriforth there&mdash;but
in their walks, and at Lord Elmwood's, the two parties would
occasionally join, and of course Sandford and she at those
times met&mdash;yet so distant was the reserve on either side,
that not a single word upon any occasion was ever exchanged
between them.</p>

<p>Miss Milner did not like Mr. Sandford; yet as there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
no cause of inveterate rancour, admiring him too as a man
who meant well, and being besides of a most forgiving temper,
she frequently felt concerned that he did not speak to her,
although it had been to find fault as usual&mdash;and one morning
as they were all, after a long ramble, drawing towards her
house, where Lord Elmwood was invited to dine, she could
not restrain dropping a tear at seeing Sandford turn back
and wish them a "Good day."</p>

<p>But though she had the generosity to forgive an affront,
she had not the humility to make a concession; and she
foresaw that nothing less than some very humble atonement
on her part would prevail upon the haughty priest to be
reconciled. Dorriforth saw her concern upon this last
trifling occasion with a secret pleasure, and an admiration
that she had never before excited. She once insinuated to
him to be a mediator between them; but before any accommodation
could take place, the peace and composure of their
abode were disturbed by the arrival of Sir Edward Ashton
at Lord Elmwood's, where it appeared as if he had been
invited in order to pursue his matrimonial plan.</p>

<p>At a dinner given by Lord Elmwood, Sir Edward was
announced as an unexpected visitor; Miss Milner did not
suppose him such, and she turned pale when his name was
uttered. Dorriforth fixed his eyes upon her with some tokens
of compassion, while Sandford seemed to exult, and by his
repeated "Welcomes" to the Baronet, gave proofs how
much he was rejoiced to see him. All the declining enmity
of Miss Milner was renewed at this behaviour, and suspecting
Sandford as the instigator of the visit, she could not overcome
her displeasure, but gave way to it in a manner she
thought the most mortifying. Sir Edward, in the course
of conversation, enquired "What neighbours were in the
country;" and she, with an appearance of high satisfaction,
named Lord Frederick Lawnly as being hourly expected at
his uncle's. The colour spread over Sir Edward's face&mdash;Dorriforth
was confounded&mdash;and Mr. Sandford looked
enraged.</p>

<p>"Did Lord Frederick tell <i>you</i> he should be down?" Sandford
asked of Dorriforth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>To which he replied, "No."</p>

<p>"But I hope, Mr. Sandford, you will permit <i>me</i> to know?"
said Miss Milner. For as she now meant to torment him
by what she said, she no longer constrained herself to silence&mdash;and
as he harboured the same kind intention towards her,
he had no longer any objection to make a reply, and therefore
answered,</p>

<p>"No, madam, if it depended upon my permission, you
should <i>not</i> know."</p>

<p>"Not <i>any thing</i>, Sir, I dare say; you would keep me in
utter ignorance."</p>

<p>"I would."</p>

<p>"From a self-interested motive, Mr. Sandford&mdash;that
I might have a greater respect for you."</p>

<p>Some of the company laughed&mdash;Mrs. Horton coughed&mdash;Miss
Woodley blushed&mdash;Lord Elmwood sneered&mdash;Dorriforth
frowned&mdash;and Miss Fenton looked just as she did before.</p>

<p>The conversation was changed as soon as possible, and early
in the evening the party from Milner Lodge returned home.</p>

<p>Miss Milner had scarce left her dressing room, where she
had been taking off some part of her dress, when Dorriforth's
servant came to acquaint her that his master was alone in
his study, and begged to speak with her. She felt herself
tremble&mdash;she immediately experienced a consciousness that
she had not acted properly at Lord Elmwood's; for she felt
a presentiment that her guardian was going to upbraid her,
and her heart whispered that he had never yet reproached
her without a cause.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley just then entered her apartment, and she
found herself so much a coward, as to propose that she
should go with her, and aid her with a word or two occasionally
in her excuse.</p>

<p>"What you, my dear," returned Miss Woodley, "who not
three hours ago had the courage to vindicate your own cause
before a whole company, of whom many were your adversaries;
do <i>you</i> want an advocate before your guardian alone,
who has ever treated you with tenderness?"</p>

<p>"It is that very tenderness which frightens me; which
intimidates, and strikes me dumb. Is it possible I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
return impertinence to the language and manners which
Mr. Dorriforth uses? and as I am debarred from that resource,
what can I do but stand before him like a guilty
creature, acknowledging my faults."</p>

<p>She again entreated her friend to go with her; but on
a positive refusal, from the impropriety of such an intrusion,
she was obliged at length to go by herself.</p>

<p>How much does the difference of exterior circumstances
influence not only the manners, but even the persons of
some people! Miss Milner in Lord Elmwood's drawing
room, surrounded by listeners, by admirers, (for even her
enemies could not look at her without admiration) animated
with approbation and applause&mdash;and Miss Milner, with no
giddy observer to give her actions a false &eacute;clat, destitute of
all but her own understanding, (which secretly condemns
her) upon the point of receiving censure from her guardian
and friend, are two different beings. Though still beautiful
beyond description, she does not look even in person the
same. In the last-mentioned situation, she was shorter in
stature than in the former&mdash;she was paler&mdash;she was thinner&mdash;and
a very different contour presided over her whole air,
and all her features.</p>

<p>When she arrived at the door of the study, she opened it
with a trepidation she could hardly account for, and entered
to Dorriforth the altered woman she has been represented.
His heart had taken the most decided part against her, and
his face had assumed the most severe aspect of reproach;
but her appearance gave an instantaneous change to his
whole mind, and countenance.</p>

<p>She halted, as if she feared to approach&mdash;he hesitated, as
if he knew not how to speak. Instead of the anger with
which he was prepared to begin, his voice involuntarily
softened, and without knowing what he said, he began,</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Milner."&mdash;</p>

<p>She expected he was angry, and in her confusion his gentleness
was lost upon her. She imagined that what he said
might be censure, and she continued to tremble, though he
repeatedly assured her, that he meant only to advise, not
upbraid her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"For as to all those little disputes between Mr. Sandford
and you," said he, "I should be partial if I blamed you
more than him&mdash;indeed, when you take the liberty to condemn
him, his character makes the freedom appear in a more
serious light than when he complains of you&mdash;and yet, if
he provokes your retorts, he alone must answer for them; nor
will I undertake to decide betwixt you. But I have a question
to ask you, and to which I require a serious and unequivocal
answer. Do you expect Lord Frederick in the country?"</p>

<p>Without hesitation she replied, "I do."</p>

<p>"One more question I have to ask, madam, and to which
I expect a reply equally unreserved. Is Lord Frederick the
man you approve for your husband?"</p>

<p>Upon this close interrogation she discovered an embarrassment,
beyond any she had ever yet betrayed, and faintly
replied,</p>

<p>"No, he is not."</p>

<p>"Your words tell me one thing," answered Dorriforth,
"but your looks declare another&mdash;which am I to believe?"</p>

<p>"Which you please," was her answer, while she discovered
an insulted dignity, that astonished, without convincing him.</p>

<p>"But then why encourage him to follow you hither, Miss
Milner?"</p>

<p>"Why commit a thousand follies (she replied in tears)
every hour of my life?"</p>

<p>"You then promote the hopes of Lord Frederick without
one serious intention of completing them? This is a conduct
against which it is my duty to guard you, and you shall no
longer deceive either him or yourself. The moment he
arrives, it is my resolution that you refuse to see him, or
consent to become his wife."</p>

<p>In answer to the alternative thus offered, she appeared
averse to both propositions; and yet came to no explanation
why; but left her guardian at the end of the conference as
much at a loss to decide upon her true sentiments, as he was
before he had thus seriously requested he might be informed
of them; but having stedfastly taken the resolution which
he had just communicated, he found that resolution a certain
relief to his mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_XII" id="I_CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Sir Edward Ashton, though not invited by Miss Milner,
yet frequently did himself the honour to visit her at her
house; sometimes he accompanied Lord Elmwood, at other
times he came to see Dorriforth alone, who generally introduced
him to the ladies. But Sir Edward was either so
unwilling to give pain to the object of his love, or so intimidated
by her frowns, that he seldom addressed her with
a single word, except the usual compliments at entering,
and retiring. This apprehension of offending, without one
hope of pleasing, had the most awkward effect upon the
manners of the worthy Baronet; and his endeavours to
insinuate himself into the affections of the woman he loved,
merely by not giving her offence either in speaking to her
or looking at her, formed a character so whimsical, that it
frequently forced a smile from Miss Milner, though his very
name had often power to throw a gloom over her face: she
looked upon him as the cause of her being hurried to the
election of a lover, before her own mind could well direct her
where to fix. Besides, his pursuit was troublesome, while it
was no triumph to her vanity, which by the addresses of
Lord Frederick, was in the highest manner gratified.</p>

<p>His Lordship now arrives in the country, and calls one
morning at Miss Milner's; her guardian sees his carriage
coming up the avenue, and gives orders to the servants, to
say their lady is not at home, but that Mr. Dorriforth is:
Lord Frederick leaves his compliments and goes away.</p>

<p>The ladies all observed his carriage and servants. Miss
Milner flew to her glass, adjusted her dress, and in her looks
expressed every sign of palpitation&mdash;but in vain she keeps her
eye fixed upon the door of the apartment; no Lord Frederick
appears.</p>

<p>After some minutes of expectation, the door opens and her
guardian comes in;&mdash;she was disappointed; he perceived
that she was, and he looked at her with a most serious face;&mdash;she
immediately called to mind the assurance he had given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
her, "That her acquaintance with Lord Frederick in its
then improper state should not continue," and between
chagrin and confusion, she was at a loss how to behave.</p>

<p>Though the ladies were all present, Dorriforth said, without
the smallest reserve, "Perhaps, Miss Milner, you may
think I have taken an unwarrantable liberty, in giving orders
to your servants to deny you to Lord Frederick; but until
his Lordship and I have had a private conference, or you
condescend to declare your sentiments more fully in regard
to his visits, I think it my duty to put an end to them."</p>

<p>"You will always perform your duty, Mr. Dorriforth,
I have no doubt, whether I concur or not."</p>

<p>"Yet believe me, madam, I should perform it more cheerfully,
if I could hope that it was sanctioned by your inclinations."</p>

<p>"I am not mistress of my inclinations, Sir, or they should
conform to yours."</p>

<p>"Place them under my direction, and I will answer for it
they will."</p>

<p>A servant came in&mdash;"Lord Frederick is returned, Sir, and
says he should be glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Shew him into the
study," cried Dorriforth hastily, and rising from his chair,
left the room.</p>

<p>"I hope they won't quarrel," said Mrs. Horton, meaning,
that she thought they would.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you so uneasy, Miss Milner," said Miss
Fenton, with perfect unconcern.</p>

<p>As the badness of the weather had prevented their usual
morning's exercise, the ladies were employed at their needles
till the dinner bell called them away. "Do you think Lord
Frederick is gone?" then whispered Miss Milner to Miss
Woodley.&mdash;"I think not," she replied.&mdash;"Go ask of the servants,
dear creature." And Miss Woodley went out of the
room. She soon returned and said, apart, "He is now
getting into his chariot; I saw him pass in violent haste
through the hall; he seemed to fly."</p>

<p>"Ladies, the dinner is waiting," cried Mrs. Horton, and
they repaired to the dining room, where Dorriforth soon
after came, and engrossed their whole attention by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
disturbed looks, and unusual silence. Before dinner was
over, he was, however, more himself, but still he appeared
thoughtful and dissatisfied. At the time of their evening
walk he excused himself from accompanying them, and they
saw him in a distant field with Mr. Sandford in earnest conversation;
for Sandford and he often stopped on one spot
for a quarter of an hour, as if the interest of the subject had
so engaged them, they stood still without knowing it.
Lord Elmwood, who had joined the ladies, walked home
with them; Dorriforth entered soon after, in a much less
gloomy humour than when he went out, and told his
relation, that he and the ladies would dine with him the
next day if he was disengaged; and it was agreed they
should.</p>

<p>Still Dorriforth was in some perturbation, but the immediate
cause was concealed till the day following, when, about
an hour before the company's departure from the Castle,
Miss Milner and Miss Woodley were desired, by a servant,
to walk into a separate apartment, in which they found
Mr. Dorriforth with Mr. Sandford waiting for them. Her
guardian made an apology to Miss Milner for the form, the
ceremony, of which he was going to make use; but he trusted,
the extreme weight which oppressed his mind, lest he should
mistake the real sentiments of a person whose happiness
depended upon his correct knowledge of them, would plead
his excuse.</p>

<p>"I know, Miss Milner," continued he, "the world in
general allows to unmarried women great latitude in disguising
their mind with respect to the man they love. I too, am
willing to pardon any little dissimulation that is but consistent
with a modesty that becomes every woman upon the
subject of marriage. But here, to what point I may limit,
or you may extend, this kind of venial deceit, may so widely
differ, that it is not impossible for me to remain unacquainted
with your sentiments, even after you have revealed them to
me. Under this consideration, I wish once more to hear
your thoughts in regard to matrimony, and to hear them
before one of your own sex, that I may form an opinion by
her constructions."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>To all this serious oration, Miss Milner made no other
reply than by turning to Mr. Sandford, and asking, "If he
was the person of her own sex, to whose judgment her
guardian was to submit his own?"</p>

<p>"Madam," cried Sandford angrily, "you are come hither
upon serious business."</p>

<p>"Any business must be serious to me, Mr. Sandford, in
which you are concerned; and if you had called it <i>sorrowful</i>,
the epithet would have suited as well."</p>

<p>"Miss Milner," said her guardian, "I did not bring you
here to contend with Mr. Sandford."</p>

<p>"Then why, Sir, bring him hither? for where he and I are,
there must be contention."</p>

<p>"I brought him hither, Madam, or I should rather say,
brought you to this house, merely that he might be present
on this occasion, and with his discernment relieve me from
a suspicion, that my own judgment is neither able to suppress
nor to confirm."</p>

<p>"Are there any more witnesses you may wish to call in,
Sir, to remove your doubts of my veracity? if there are,
pray send for them before you begin your interrogations."</p>

<p>He shook his head&mdash;she continued.</p>

<p>"The whole world is welcome to hear what I say, and
every different person is welcome to judge me differently."</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Milner,"&mdash;cried Miss Woodley, with a tone
of reproach for the vehemence with which she had
spoken.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Miss Milner," said Dorriforth, "you will not
now reply to those questions I was going to put?"</p>

<p>"Did I ever refuse, Sir," returned she with a self-approving
air, "to comply with any request that you have seriously
made? Have I ever refused obedience to your commands
whenever you thought proper to lay them upon me? If not,
you have no right to suppose that I will do so now."</p>

<p>He was going to reply, when Mr. Sandford sullenly interrupted
him, and making towards the door, cried, "When
you come to the point for which you brought me here, send
for me again."</p>

<p>"Stay now," said Dorriforth. "And Miss Milner," con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>tinued
he, "I not only entreat, but command you to tell
me&mdash;have you given your word, or your affections to Lord
Frederick Lawnly?"</p>

<p>The colour spread over her face, and she replied&mdash;"I
thought confessions were always to be in secret; however,
as I am not a member of your church, I submit to the persecution
of a heretic, and I answer&mdash;Lord Frederick has neither
my word, nor any share in my affections."</p>

<p>Sandford, Dorriforth, and Miss Woodley looked at each
other with a degree of surprise that for some time kept them
silent. At length Dorriforth said, "And it is your firm
intention never to become his wife?"</p>

<p>To which she answered&mdash;"At present it is."</p>

<p>"At present! do you suspect you shall change your
sentiments?"</p>

<p>"Women sometimes do."</p>

<p>"But before that change can take place, your acquaintance
will be at an end: for it is that which I shall next insist upon,
and to which you can have no objection."</p>

<p>She replied, "I had rather it should continue."</p>

<p>"On what account?" cried Dorriforth.</p>

<p>"Because it entertains me."</p>

<p>"For shame, for shame!" returned he; "it endangers
your character and your happiness. Yet again, do not suffer
me to interfere, if the breaking with Lord Frederick can
militate against your felicity."</p>

<p>"By no means," she answered; "Lord Frederick makes
part of my amusement, but could never constitute my
felicity."</p>

<p>"Miss Woodley," said Dorriforth, "do you comprehend
your friend in the same literal and unequivocal sense that
I do?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do, Sir."</p>

<p>"And pray, Miss Woodley," said he, "were those the
sentiments which you have always entertained?"</p>

<p>Miss Woodley hesitated&mdash;he continued. "Or has this
conversation altered them?"</p>

<p>She hesitated again, then answered&mdash;"This conversation
has altered them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"And yet you confide in it!" cried Sandford, looking at
her with contempt.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," replied Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Do not you then, Mr. Sandford?" asked Dorriforth.</p>

<p>"I would advise you to act as if I did," replied Sandford.</p>

<p>"Then, Miss Milner," said Dorriforth, "you see Lord
Frederick no more&mdash;and I hope I have your permission to
apprize him of this arrangement."</p>

<p>"You have, Sir," she replied with a completely unembarrassed
countenance and voice.</p>

<p>Her friend looked at her as if to discover some lurking wish,
adverse to all these protestations, but she could not discern
one. Sandford too fixed his penetrating eyes upon her, as
if he would look through her soul, but finding it perfectly
composed, he cried out,</p>

<p>"Why then not write his dismission herself, and save you,
Mr. Dorriforth, the trouble of any farther contest with
him?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Miss Milner," said Dorriforth, "that would
oblige me; for it is with great reluctance that I meet him
upon this subject&mdash;he was extremely impatient and importunate
when he was last with me&mdash;he took advantage of my
ecclesiastical situation to treat me with a levity and ill
breeding, that I could ill have suffered upon any other
consideration than a compliance with my duty."</p>

<p>"Dictate what you please, Mr. Dorriforth, and I will
write it," said she, with a warmth like the most unaffected
inclination. "And while you, Sir," she continued, "are so
indulgent as not to distress me with the importunities of any
gentleman to whom I am averse, I think myself equally
bound to rid you of the impertinence of every one to whom
you may have objection."</p>

<p>"But," answered he, "rest assured I have no material
objection to my Lord Frederick, except from that dilemma,
in which your acquaintance with him has involved us all;
and I should conceive the same against any other man, where
the same circumstance occurred. As you have now, however,
freely and politely consented to the manner in which it has
been proposed that you shall break with him, I will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
trouble you a moment longer upon a subject on which I have
so frequently explained my wishes, but conclude it by
assuring you, that your ready acquiescence has given me
the sincerest satisfaction."</p>

<p>"I hope, Mr. Sandford," said she, turning to him with
a smile, "I have given <i>you</i> satisfaction likewise?"</p>

<p>Sandford could not say yes, and was ashamed to say no;
he, therefore, made answer only by his looks, which were
full of suspicion. She, notwithstanding, made him a very
low courtesy. Her guardian then handed her out of the
apartment into her coach, which was waiting to take her,
Miss Woodley, and himself, home.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Notwithstanding the seeming readiness with which Miss
Milner had resigned all farther acquaintance with Lord
Frederick, during the short ride home she appeared to have
lost great part of her wonted spirits; she was thoughtful,
and once sighed heavily. Dorriforth began to fear that she
had not only made a sacrifice of her affections, but of her
veracity; yet, why she had done so, he could not comprehend.</p>

<p>As the carriage moved slowly through a lane between
Elmwood Castle and her own house, on casting her eyes out
of the window, Miss Milner's countenance was brightened
in an instant, and that instant Lord Frederick, on horse-back,
was at the coach door, and the coachman stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Milner," cried he, (with a voice and manner
that could give little suspicion of the truth of what he said)
"I am overjoyed at the happiness of seeing you, even though
it is but an accidental meeting."</p>

<p>She was evidently glad to see <i>him</i>; but the earnestness
with which he spoke, put her upon her guard not to express
the like, and she said, in a cool constrained manner, she
"Was glad to see his Lordship."</p>

<p>The reserve with which she spoke, gave Lord Frederick
immediate suspicion who was in the coach with her, and
turning his head quickly, he met the stern eye of Dorriforth;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
upon which, without the smallest salutation, he turned from
him again abruptly and rudely. Miss Milner was confused,
and Miss Woodley in torture, at this palpable affront, to
which Dorriforth alone appeared indifferent.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Miss Milner to the footman, "desire the
coachman to drive on."</p>

<p>"No," cried Lord Frederick, "not till you have told me
when I shall see you again."</p>

<p>"I will write you word, my Lord," replied she, something
alarmed. "You shall have a letter immediately after I get
home."</p>

<p>As if he guessed what its contents were to be, he cried
out with warmth, "Take care, then, Madam, how you treat
me in that letter&mdash;and you, Mr. Dorriforth," turning to
him, "do you take care what it contains; for if it is dictated
by you, to you I shall send the answer."</p>

<p>Dorriforth, without making any reply, or casting a look
at him, put his head out of the window on the opposite side,
and called, in a very angry tone, to the coachman, "How
dare you not drive on, when your Lady orders you?"</p>

<p>The sound of Dorriforth's voice in anger, was to the
servants so unusual, that it acted like electricity upon the
man, and he drove on at the instant with such rapidity,
that Lord Frederick was in a moment left many yards behind.
As soon, however, as he recovered from the surprise into
which this sudden command had thrown him, he rode with
speed after the carriage, and followed it, till it arrived at the
door of Miss Milner's house; there, giving himself up to the
rage of love, or to rage against Dorriforth for the contempt
he had shewn to him, he leaped from his horse when Miss
Milner stepped from her carriage, and seizing her hand,
entreated her "Not to desert him, in compliance with the
injunctions of monkish hypocrisy."</p>

<p>Dorriforth heard this, standing silently by, with a manly
scorn upon his countenance.</p>

<p>Miss Milner struggled to loose her hand, saying, "Excuse
me from replying to you now, my Lord."</p>

<p>In return, he lifted her hand eagerly to his lips, and began
to devour it with kisses; when Dorriforth, with an instan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>taneous
impulse, rushed forward, and struck him a violent
blow in the face. Under the force of this assault, and the
astonishment it excited, Lord Frederick staggered, and
letting fall the hand of Miss Milner, her guardian immediately
laid hold of it, and led her into the house.</p>

<p>She was terrified beyond description; and with extreme
difficulty Mr. Dorriforth conveyed her to her own chamber,
without taking her in his arms. When, by the assistance of
her maid, he had placed her upon a sofa&mdash;covered with
shame and confusion for what he had done, he fell upon his
knees before her, and earnestly "Entreated her forgiveness
for the indelicacy he had been guilty of in her presence."
And that he had alarmed her, and had forgot the respect
which he thought sacredly her due, seemed the only circumstance
which then dwelt upon his thoughts.</p>

<p>She felt the indecorum of the posture he had condescended
to take, and was shocked. To see her guardian at her feet,
struck her with a sense of impropriety, as if she had seen
a parent there. All agitation and emotion, she implored
him to rise, and, with a thousand protestations, declared,
"That she thought the rashness of the action was the highest
proof of his regard for her."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley now entered; her care being ever employed
upon the unfortunate, Lord Frederick had been the object of
it: she had waited by his side, and, with every good purpose,
had preached patience to him, while he was smarting under
the pain, but more under the shame, of his chastisement.
At first, his fury threatened a retort upon the servants
around him (and who refused his entrance into the house) of
the punishment he had received. But, in the certainty of
an <i>amende honorable</i>, which must hereafter be made, he
overcame the many temptations which the moment offered,
and re-mounting his horse rode away from the scene of his
disgrace.</p>

<p>No sooner had Miss Woodley entered the room, and
Dorriforth had resigned to her the care of his ward, than he
flew to the spot where he had left Lord Frederick, negligent
of what might be the event if he still remained there. After
enquiring, and being told that he was gone, Dorriforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
returned to his own apartment; and with a bosom torn by
more excruciating sensations than those which he had given
to his adversary.</p>

<p>The reflection that struck him first with remorse, as he
shut the door upon himself, was:&mdash;"I have departed from
my character&mdash;from the sacred character, and the dignity
of my profession and sentiments&mdash;I have departed from
myself. I am no longer the philosopher, but the ruffian&mdash;I
have treated with an unpardonable insult a young nobleman,
whose only offence was love, and a fond desire to
insinuate himself into the favour of his mistress. I must
atone for this outrage in whatever manner he may choose;
and the law of honour and of justice (though in this one
instance contrary to the law of religion) enjoins, that if he
demands my life in satisfaction for his wounded feelings, it
is his due. Alas! that I could have laid it down this morning,
unsullied with a cause for which it will make but inadequate
atonement."</p>

<p>His next reproach was&mdash;"I have offended and filled with
horror, a beautiful young woman, whom it was my duty to
have protected from those brutal manners, to which I myself
have exposed her."</p>

<p>Again&mdash;"I have drawn upon myself the just upbraidings
of my faithful preceptor and friend; of the man in whose
judgment it was my delight to be approved&mdash;above all,
I have drawn upon myself the stings of my conscience."</p>

<p>"Where shall I pass this sleepless night?" cried he, walking
repeatedly across his chamber; "Can I go to the ladies?
I am unworthy of their society. Shall I go and repose my
disturbed mind on Sandford? I am ashamed to tell him
the cause of my uneasiness. Shall I go to Lord Frederick,
and humbling myself before him, beg his forgiveness? He
would spurn me for a coward. No"&mdash;&mdash;(and he lifted up
his eyes to Heaven) "Thou all great, all wise and omnipotent
Being, Thou whom I have most offended, it is to Thee
alone that I have recourse in this hour of tribulation, and
from Thee alone I solicit comfort. And the confidence in
which I now address myself to Thee, encouraged by that
long intercourse which religion has effected, repays me amply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in this one moment, for the many years of my past life
devoted with my best, though imperfect, efforts to thy
service."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Although Miss Milner had not foreseen any fatal event
resulting from the indignity offered to Lord Frederick, yet
she passed a night very different from those to which she had
been accustomed. No sooner was she falling into a sleep,
than a thousand vague, but distressing, ideas darted across
her imagination. Her heart would sometimes whisper to
her when she was half asleep, "Lord Frederick is banished
from you for ever." She shakes off the uneasiness this idea
brings along with it&mdash;she then starts, and sees the blow still
aimed at him by Dorriforth. No sooner has she driven away
this painful image, than she is again awakened by beholding
her guardian at her feet sueing for pardon. She sighs, she
trembles, and is chilled with terror.</p>

<p>Relieved by tears, towards the morning she sinks into
a slumber, but waking, finds the same images crowding all
together upon her mind: she is doubtful to which to give
the preference&mdash;one, however, rushes the foremost, and
continues so. She knows not the fatal consequence of
ruminating, nor why she dwells upon that, more than upon
all the rest, but it will give place to none.</p>

<p>She rises languid and disordered, and at breakfast, adds
fresh pain to Dorriforth by her altered appearance.</p>

<p>He had scarce left the room, when an officer waited upon
him with a challenge from Lord Frederick. To the message
delivered by this gentleman, he replied,</p>

<p>"Sir, as a clergyman, more especially of the church of
Rome, I know not whether I am not exempt from answering
a demand of this kind; but not having had forbearance to
avoid an offence, I will not claim an exemption that would
only indemnify me from making reparation."</p>

<p>"You will then, Sir, meet Lord Frederick at the appointed
hour?" said the officer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, Sir; and my immediate care shall be to find
a gentleman who will accompany me."</p>

<p>The officer withdrew, and when Dorriforth was again
alone, he was going once more to reflect, but he durst not.
Since yesterday, reflection, for the first time, was become
painful to him; and even as he rode the short way to Lord
Elmwood's immediately after, he found his own thoughts
were so insufferable, that he was obliged to enter into conversation
with his servant. Solitude, that formerly charmed him,
would, at those moments, have been worse than death.</p>

<p>At Lord Elmwood's, he met Sandford in the hall, and the
sight of him was no longer welcome&mdash;he knew how different
the principles which he had just adopted were to those of
that reverend friend, and without his complaining, or even
suspecting what had happened, his presence was a sufficient
reproach. He passed him as hastily as he could, and enquiring
for Lord Elmwood, disclosed to him his errand. It was
to ask him to be his second;&mdash;the young Earl started, and
wished to consult his tutor, but that, his kinsman strictly
forbade; and having urged his reasons with arguments,
which at least <i>he</i> could not refute, he was at length prevailed
upon to promise that he would accompany him to the field,
which was at the distance only of a few miles, and the parties
were to be there at seven on the same evening.</p>

<p>As soon as his business with Lord Elmwood was settled,
Dorriforth returned home, to make preparations for the event
which might ensue from this meeting. He wrote letters to
several of his friends, and one to his ward, in writing which,
he could with difficulty preserve the usual firmness of his mind.
Sandford going into Lord Elmwood's library soon after his
relation had left him, expressed his surprise at finding he was
gone; upon which that nobleman having answered a few
questions, and given a few significant hints that he was
entrusted with a secret, frankly confessed, what he had
promised to conceal.</p>

<p>Sandford, as much as a holy man could be, was enraged at
Dorriforth for the cause of the challenge, but was still more
enraged at his wickedness in accepting it. He applauded
his pupil's virtue in making the discovery, and congratulated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
himself that he should be the instrument of saving not only
his friend's life, but of preventing the scandal of his being
engaged in a duel.</p>

<p>In the ardour of his designs, he went immediately to Miss
Milner's&mdash;entered that house which he had so long refused
to enter, and at a time when he was upon aggravated bad
terms with its owner.</p>

<p>He asked for Dorriforth, went hastily into his apartment,
and poured upon him a torrent of rebukes. Dorriforth bore
all he said with the patience of a devotee, but with the
firmness of a man. He owned his fault, but no eloquence
could make him recall the promise he had given to repair
the injury. Unshaken by the arguments, persuasions, and
menaces of Sandford, he gave an additional proof of that
inflexibility for which he had been long distinguished&mdash;and
after a dispute of two hours, they parted, neither of them
the better for what either had advanced, but Dorriforth
something the worse; his conscience gave testimony to
Sandford's opinion, "that he was bound by ties more sacred
than worldly honour." But while he owned, he would not
yield to the duty.</p>

<p>Sandford left him, determined, however, that Lord
Elmwood should not be accessory in his guilt, and this he
declared; upon which Dorriforth took the resolution of
seeking another second.</p>

<p>In passing through the house on his return home, Sandford
met, by accident, Mrs. Horton, Miss Milner, and the other
two ladies returning from a saunter in the garden. Surprised
at the sight of Mr. Sandford in her house, Miss
Milner would not express that surprise, but going up to him
with all the friendly benevolence which in general played
about her heart, she took hold of one of his hands, and
pressed it with a kindness which told him more forcibly
that he was welcome, than if she had made the most
elaborate speech to convince him of it. He, however, seemed
little touched with her behaviour, and as an excuse for
breaking his word, cried,</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madam, but I was brought hither in
my anxiety to prevent murder."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Murder!" exclaimed all the ladies.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered he, addressing himself to Miss Fenton,
"your betrothed husband is a party concerned; he is going
to be second to Mr. Dorriforth, who means this very evening
to be killed by my Lord Frederick, or to kill him, in addition
to the blow that he gave him last night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton exclaimed, "if Mr. Dorriforth dies, he dies
a martyr."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley cried with fervour, "Heaven forbid!"</p>

<p>Miss Fenton cried, "dear me!"</p>

<p>While Miss Milner, without uttering one word, sunk
speechless on the floor.</p>

<p>They lifted her up and brought her to the door which
entered into the garden. She soon recovered; for the
tumult of her mind would not suffer her to remain inactive,
and she was rouzed, in spite of her weakness, to endeavour
to ward off the impending disaster. In vain, however, she
attempted to walk to her guardian's apartment&mdash;she sunk
as before, and was taken to a settee, while Miss Woodley was
dispatched to bring him to her.</p>

<p>Informed of the cause of her indisposition, he followed
Miss Woodley with a tender anxiety for her health, and with
grief and confusion that he had so carelessly endangered it.
On his entering the room Sandford beheld the inquietude of
his mind, and cried, "Here is your <i>Guardian</i>," with a cruel
emphasis on the word.</p>

<p>He was too much engaged by the sufferings of his ward to
reply to Sandford. He placed himself on the settee by her,
and with the utmost tenderness, reverence, and pity, entreated
her not to be concerned at an accident in which he,
and he alone, had been to blame; but which he had no
doubt would be accommodated in the most amicable
manner.</p>

<p>"I have one favour to require of you, Mr. Dorriforth,"
said she, "and that is, your promise, your solemn promise,
which I know is ever sacred, that you will not meet my Lord
Frederick."</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, Madam," cried Sandford, "he is grown a libertine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
now, and I would not believe his word, if he were to give
it you."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir," returned Dorriforth angrily, "you <i>may</i>
believe my word, for I will keep that which I gave to <i>you</i>.
I will give Lord Frederick all the restitution in my power.
But my dear Miss Milner, let not this alarm you; we may
not find it convenient to meet this many a day; and most
probably some fortunate explanation may prevent our
meeting at all. If not, reckon but among the many duels
that are fought, how few are fatal: and even in that case,
how small would be the loss to society, if&mdash;&mdash;" He was
proceeding.</p>

<p>"I should ever deplore the loss!" cried Miss Milner;
"on such an occasion, I could not survive the death of
either."</p>

<p>"For my part," he replied, "I look upon my life as much
forfeited to my Lord Frederick, to whom I have given
a high offence, as it might in other instances have been
forfeited to the offended laws of the land. Honour, is the
law of the polite part of the land; we know it; and when
we transgress against it knowingly, we justly incur our
punishment. However, Miss Milner, this affair will not be
settled immediately, and I have no doubt, but that all will
be as you could wish. Do you think I should appear thus
easy," added he with a smile, "if I were going to be shot at
by my Lord Frederick?"</p>

<p>"Very well!" cried Sandford, with a look that evinced
he was better informed.</p>

<p>"You will stay within then, all this day?" said Miss
Milner.</p>

<p>"I am engaged to dinner," he replied; "it is unlucky&mdash;I
am sorry for it&mdash;but I'll be at home early in the evening."</p>

<p>"Stained with human blood," cried Sandford, "or yourself
a corpse."</p>

<p>The ladies lifted up their hands!&mdash;Miss Milner rose from
her seat, and threw herself at her guardian's feet.</p>

<p>"You kneeled to me last night, I now kneel to you," (she
cried) "kneel, never desiring to rise again, if you persist in
your intention. I am weak, I am volatile, I am indiscreet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
but I have a heart from which some impressions can never&mdash;oh!
never, be erased."</p>

<p>He endeavoured to raise her, she persisted to kneel&mdash;and
here the affright, the terror, the anguish, she endured,
discovered to her, her own sentiments&mdash;which, till that
moment, she had doubted&mdash;and she continued,</p>

<p>"I no longer pretend to conceal my passion&mdash;I love Lord
Frederick Lawnly."</p>

<p>Her guardian started.</p>

<p>"Yes, to my shame I love him:" (cried she, all emotion)
"I meant to have struggled with the weakness, because
I supposed it would be displeasing to you&mdash;but apprehension
for his safety has taken away every power of restraint, and
I beseech you to spare his life."</p>

<p>"This is exactly what I thought," cried Sandford, with
an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"Good heaven!" cried Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"But it is very natural," said Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>"I own," said Dorriforth, (struck with amaze, and now
taking her from his feet with a force that she could not
resist) "I own, Miss Milner, I am greatly affected and
wounded at this contradiction in your character."&mdash;</p>

<p>"But did not I say so?" cried Sandford, interrupting him.</p>

<p>"However," continued he, "you may take my word,
though you have deceived me in your's, that Lord Frederick's
life is secure. For your sake, I would not endanger it for
the universe. But let this be a warning to you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was proceeding with the most austere looks, and
pointed language, when observing the shame, and the self-reproach
that agitated her mind, he divested himself in great
measure of his resentment, and said, mildly,</p>

<p>"Let this be a warning to you, how you deal in future
with the friends who wish you well. You have hurried me
into a mistake that might have cost me my life, or the life
of the man you love; and thus exposed <i>you</i> to misery, more
bitter than death."</p>

<p>"I am not worthy of your friendship, Mr. Dorriforth,"
said she, sobbing with grief, "and from this moment forsake
me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Madam, not in the moment you first discover to me,
how I can make you happy."</p>

<p>The conversation appearing now to become of a nature
in which the rest of the company could have no share whatever,
they were all, except Mr. Sandford, retiring; when
Miss Milner called Miss Woodley back, saying, "Stay you
with me; I was never so unfit to be left without your
friendship."</p>

<p>"Perhaps at present you can dispense with mine?" said
Dorriforth. She made no answer. He then, once more
assured her Lord Frederick's life was safe, and was quitting
the room&mdash;but when he recollected in what humiliation he
had left her, turning towards her as he opened the door,
he added,</p>

<p>"And be assured, Madam, that my esteem for you, shall
be <i>the same as ever</i>."</p>

<p>Sandford, as he followed him, bowed, and repeated the
same words&mdash;"And, Madam, be assured that my esteem for
you, shall be the same as ever."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>This taunting reproof from Sandford made little impression
upon Miss Milner, whose thoughts were all fixed on a subject
of much more importance than the opinion which he entertained
of her. She threw her arms about her friend the
moment they were left alone, and asked, with anxiety, "What
she thought of her behaviour?" Miss Woodley, who could
not approve of the duplicity she had betrayed, still wished
to reconcile her as much as possible to her own conduct, and
replied, she "Highly commended the frankness with which
she had, at last, acknowledged her sentiments."</p>

<p>"Frankness!" cried Miss Milner, starting. "Frankness,
my dear Miss Woodley! What you have just now heard
me say, is all a falsehood."</p>

<p>"How, Miss Milner!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Woodley," returned she, sobbing upon her
bosom, "pity the agonies of my heart, my heart, by nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
sincere, when such are the fatal propensities it cherishes,
that I must submit to the grossest falsehoods rather than
reveal the truth."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" cried Miss Woodley, with the
strongest amazement in her face.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I love Lord Frederick? Do you suppose
I <i>can</i> love him? Oh fly, and prevent my guardian from
telling him such an untruth."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" repeated Miss Woodley;
"I protest you terrify me." For this inconsistency in the
behaviour of Miss Milner, appeared as if her senses had been
deranged.</p>

<p>"Fly," she resumed, "and prevent the inevitable ill
consequence which will ensue, if Lord Frederick should be
told this falsehood. It will involve us all in greater disquiet
than we suffer at present."</p>

<p>"Then what has influenced you, my dear Miss Milner?"</p>

<p>"That which impels all my actions&mdash;an unsurmountable
instinct&mdash;a fatality, that will for ever render me the most
miserable of human beings; and yet you, even you, my dear
Miss Woodley, will not pity me."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley pressed her closely in her arms, and vowed,
"That while she was unhappy, from whatever cause, she
still would pity her."</p>

<p>"Go to Mr. Dorriforth then, and prevent him from
imposing upon Lord Frederick."</p>

<p>"But that imposition is the only means of preventing the
duel," replied Miss Woodley. "The moment I have told
him that your affection was but counterfeited, he will no
longer refuse accepting the challenge."</p>

<p>"Then at all events I am undone," exclaimed Miss Milner,
"for the duel is horrible, even beyond every thing else."</p>

<p>"How so?" returned Miss Woodley, "since you have
declared you do not care for Lord Frederick?"</p>

<p>"But are you so blind," returned Miss Milner with a degree
of madness in her looks, "as to believe I do not care for
Mr. Dorriforth? Oh! Miss Woodley! I love him with all
the passion of a mistress, and with all the tenderness of
a wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Woodley at this sentence sat down&mdash;it was on a chair
that was close to her&mdash;her feet could not have taken her to
any other. She trembled&mdash;she was white as ashes, and
deprived of speech. Miss Milner, taking her by the hand,
said,</p>

<p>"I know what you feel&mdash;I know what you think of me&mdash;and
how much you hate and despise me. But Heaven is
witness to all my struggles&mdash;nor would I, even to myself,
acknowledge the shameless prepossession, till forced by a
sense of his danger"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Silence," cried Miss Woodley, struck with horror.</p>

<p>"And even now," resumed Miss Milner, "have I not
concealed it from all but you, by plunging myself into a new
difficulty, from which I know not how I shall be extricated?
And do I entertain a hope? No, Miss Woodley, nor ever will.
But suffer me to own my folly to you&mdash;to entreat your soothing
friendship to free me from my weakness. And, oh! give
me your advice, to deliver me from the difficulties which
surround me."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was still pale, and still silent.</p>

<p>Education, is called second nature; in the strict (but not
enlarged) education of Miss Woodley, it was more powerful
than the first&mdash;and the violation of oaths, persons, or things
consecrated to Heaven, was, in her opinion, if not the most
enormous, yet among the most terrific in the catalogue of
crimes.</p>

<p>Miss Milner had lived so long in a family who had imbibed
those opinions, that she was convinced of their existence;
nay, her own reason told her that solemn vows of every kind,
ought to be sacred; and the more she respected her guardian's
understanding, the less did she call in question his religious
tenets&mdash;in esteeming him, she esteemed all his notions; and
among the rest, venerated those of his religion. Yet that
passion, which had unhappily taken possession of her whole
soul, would not have been inspired, had there not subsisted
an early difference, in their systems of divine faith. Had
she been early taught what were the sacred functions of
a Roman ecclesiastic, though all her esteem, all her admiration,
had been attracted by the qualities and accomplishments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of her guardian, yet education, would have given such a prohibition
to her love, that she would have been precluded
from it, as by that barrier which divides a sister from a
brother.</p>

<p>This, unfortunately, was not the case; and Miss Milner
loved Dorriforth without one conscious check to tell her
she was wrong, except that which convinced her&mdash;her love
would be avoided by him with detestation, and with
horror.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, something recovered from her first surprise,
and sufferings&mdash;for never did her susceptible mind suffer so
exquisitely&mdash;amidst all her grief and abhorrence, felt that
pity was still predominant&mdash;and reconciled to the faults of
Miss Milner by her misery, she once more looked at her with
friendship, and asked, "What she could do to render her
less unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Make me forget," replied Miss Milner, "every moment
of my life since I first saw you&mdash;that moment was teeming
with a weight of cares, under which I must labour till my
death."</p>

<p>"And even in death," replied Miss Woodley, "do not
hope to shake them off. If unrepented in this world"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She was proceeding&mdash;but the anxiety her friend endured,
would not suffer her to be free from the apprehension, that,
notwithstanding the positive assurance of her guardian, if he
and Lord Frederick should meet, the duel might still take
place; she therefore rang the bell and enquired if Mr. Dorriforth
was still at home?&mdash;the answer was&mdash;"He had rode
out. You remember," said Miss Woodley, "he told you
he should dine from home." This did not, however, dismiss
her fears, and she dispatched two servants different ways in
pursuit of him, acquainting them with her suspicions, and
charging them to prevent the duel. Sandford had also taken
his precautions; but though he knew the time, he did not
know the exact place of their appointment, for that Lord
Elmwood had forgot to enquire.</p>

<p>The excessive alarm which Miss Milner discovered upon
this occasion, was imputed by the servants, and by others
who were witnesses of it, to her affection for Lord Frederick;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
while none but Miss Woodley knew, or had the most distant
suspicion of the real cause.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton and Miss Fenton, who were sitting together
expatiating on the duplicity of their own sex in the instance
just before them, had, notwithstanding the interest of the
discourse, a longing desire to break it off; for they were
impatient to see this poor frail being whom they were
loading with their censure. They longed to see if she would
have the confidence to look them in the face: them, to whom
she had so often protested, that she had not the smallest
attachment to Lord Frederick, but from motives of vanity.</p>

<p>These ladies heard with infinite satisfaction that dinner had
been served, but met Miss Milner at the table with a less
degree of pleasure than they had expected; for her mind
was so totally abstracted from any consideration of <i>them</i>,
that they could not discern a single blush, or confused glance,
which their presence occasioned. No, she had before them
divulged nothing of which she was ashamed; she was only
ashamed that what she had said was not true. In the bosom
of Miss Woodley alone was that secret entrusted which could
call a blush into her face, and before her, she <i>did</i> feel confusion&mdash;before
the gentle friend, to whom she had till this
time communicated all her faults without embarrassment,
she now cast down her eyes in shame.</p>

<p>Soon after the dinner was removed, Lord Elmwood
entered; and that gallant young nobleman declared&mdash;"Mr.
Sandford had used him ill, in not permitting him to accompany
his relation; for he feared that Mr. Dorriforth would
now throw himself upon the sword of Lord Frederick, without
a single friend near to defend him." A rebuke from
the eye of Miss Woodley, which from this day had a command
over Miss Milner, restrained her from expressing the
affright she suffered from this intimation. Miss Fenton
replied, "As to that, my Lord, I see no reason why Mr. Dorriforth
and Lord Frederick should not now be friends."
"Certainly," said Mrs. Horton; "for as soon as my Lord
Frederick is made acquainted with Miss Milner's confession,
all differences must be reconciled."</p>

<p>"What confession?"
asked Lord Elmwood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Milner, to avoid hearing a repetition of that which
gave her pain even to recollect, rose in order to retire into
her own apartment, but was obliged to sit down again, till she
received the assistance of Lord Elmwood and her friend, who
led her into her dressing room. She reclined upon a sofa
there, and though left alone with that friend, a silence followed
of half an hour; nor when the conversation began,
was the name of Dorriforth once uttered&mdash;they were grown
cool and considerate since the discovery, and both were
equally fearful of naming him.</p>

<p>The vanity of the world, the folly of riches, the charms of
retirement, and such topics engaged their discourse, but not
their thoughts, for near two hours; and the first time the
word Dorriforth was spoken, was by a servant, who with
alacrity opened the dressing room door, without previously
rapping, and cried, "Madam, Mr. Dorriforth."</p>

<p>Dorriforth immediately came in, and went eagerly to Miss
Milner. Miss Woodley beheld the glow of joy and of guilt
upon her face, and did not rise to give him her seat, as was
her custom, when she was sitting by his ward and he came
to her with intelligence. He therefore stood while he
repeated all that had happened in his interview with Lord
Frederick.</p>

<p>But with her gladness to see her guardian safe, she had
forgot to enquire of the safety of his antagonist; of the man
whom she had pretended to love so passionately&mdash;even smiles
of rapture were upon her face, though Dorriforth might be
returned from putting him to death. This incongruity of
behaviour Miss Woodley observed, and was confounded&mdash;but
Dorriforth, in whose thoughts a suspicion either of her
love for him, or indifference for Lord Frederick, had no
place, easily reconciled this inconsistency, and said,</p>

<p>"You see by my countenance that all is well, and therefore
you smile on me before I tell you what has passed."</p>

<p>This brought her to the recollection of her conduct, and
now with looks ill constrained, she attempted the expression
of an alarm she did not feel.</p>

<p>"Nay, I assure you Lord Frederick is safe," he resumed,
"and the disgrace of his blow washed entirely away, by a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
drops of blood from this arm." And he laid his hand upon
his left arm, which rested in his waistcoat as a kind of sling.</p>

<p>She cast her eyes there, and seeing where the ball had
entered the coat sleeve, she gave an involuntary scream, and
sunk upon the sofa. Instead of that affectionate sympathy
which Miss Woodley used to exert upon her slightest illness
or affliction, she now addressed her in an unpitying tone,
and said, "Miss Milner, you have heard Lord Frederick is
safe, you have therefore nothing to alarm you." Nor did
she run to hold a smelling bottle, or to raise her head. Her
guardian seeing her near fainting, and without any assistance
from her friend, was going himself to give it; but on this,
Miss Woodley interfered, and having taken her head upon
her arm, assured him, "It was a weakness to which Miss
Milner was accustomed: that she would ring for her maid,
who knew how to relieve her instantly with a few drops."
Satisfied with this, Dorriforth left the room; and a surgeon
being come to examine his wound, he retired into his own
chamber.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The power delegated by the confidential to those entrusted
with their secrets, Miss Woodley was the last person on earth
to abuse&mdash;but she was also the last, who, by an accommodating
complacency, would participate in the guilt of her
friend&mdash;and there was no guilt, except that of murder, which
she thought equal to the crime in question, if it was ever
perpetrated. Adultery, reason would perhaps have informed
her, was a more pernicious evil to society; but to a religious
mind, what sound is so horrible as <i>sacrilege</i>? Of vows made
to God or to man, the former must weigh the heaviest.
Moreover, the sin of infidelity in the married state, is not
a little softened to common understandings, by its frequency;
whereas, of religious vows broken by a devotee she had never
heard; unless where the offence had been followed by such
examples of divine vengeance, such miraculous punishments
in this world, (as well as eternal punishment in the other) as
served to exaggerate the wickedness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>She, who could, and who did pardon Miss Milner, was
the person who saw her passion in the severest light, and
resolved upon every method, however harsh, to root it from
her heart&mdash;nor did she fear success, resting on the certain
assurance, that however deep her love might be fixed, it
would never be returned. Yet this confidence did not
prevent her taking every precaution, lest Dorriforth should
come to the knowledge of it. She would not have his composed
mind disturbed with such a thought&mdash;his steadfast
principles so much as shaken by the imagination&mdash;nor overwhelm
him with those self-reproaches which his fatal attraction,
unpremeditated as it was, would still have drawn upon
him.</p>

<p>With this plan of concealment, in which the natural
modesty of Miss Milner acquiesced, there was but one effort
for which this unhappy ward was not prepared; and that
was an entire separation from her guardian. She had, from
the first, cherished her passion without the most remote
prospect of a return&mdash;she was prepared to see Dorriforth,
without ever seeing him more nearly connected to her than
as her guardian and friend; but not to see him at all&mdash;for
<i>that</i>, she was not prepared.</p>

<p>But Miss Woodley reflected upon the inevitable necessity
of this measure before she made the proposal; and then
made it with a firmness that might have done honour to the
inflexibility of Dorriforth himself.</p>

<p>During the few days that intervened between her open
confession of a passion for Lord Frederick and this proposed
plan of separation, the most intricate incoherence appeared
in the character of Miss Milner&mdash;and in order to evade
a marriage with him, and conceal, at the same time, the
shameful propensity which lurked in her breast, she was once
even on the point of declaring a passion for Sir Edward
Ashton.</p>

<p>In the duel which had taken place between Lord Frederick
and Dorriforth, the latter had received the fire of his antagonist,
but positively refused to return it; by which he had
kept his promise not to endanger his Lordship's life, and
had reconciled Sandford, in great measure, to his behaviour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>&mdash;and
Sandford now (his resolution once broken) no longer
refused entering Miss Milner's house, but came whenever it
was convenient, though he yet avoided the mistress of it as
much as possible; or showed by every word and look, when
she was present, that she was still less in his favour than she
had ever been.</p>

<p>He visited Dorriforth on the evening of his engagement
with Lord Frederick, and the next morning breakfasted
with him in his own chamber; nor did Miss Milner see her
guardian after his first return from that engagement before
the following noon. She enquired, however, of his servant
how he did, and was rejoiced to hear that his wound was but
slight&mdash;yet this enquiry she durst not make before Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>When Dorriforth made his appearance the next day, it
was evident that he had thrown from his heart a load of cares;
and though they had left a languor upon his face, content
was in his voice, in his manners, in every word and action.
Far from seeming to retain any resentment against his ward,
for the danger into which her imprudence had led him, he
appeared rather to pity her indiscretion, and to wish to soothe
the perturbation which the recollection of her own conduct
had evidently raised in her mind. His endeavours were
successful&mdash;she was soothed every time he spoke to her;
and had not the watchful eye of Miss Woodley stood guard
over her inclinations, she had plainly discovered, that she
was enraptured with the joy of seeing him again himself,
after the danger to which he had been exposed.</p>

<p>These emotions, which she laboured to subdue, passed,
however, the bounds of her ineffectual resistance, when at
the time of retiring after dinner, he said to her in a low
voice, but such as it was meant the company should hear,
"Do me the favour, Miss Milner, to call at my study some
time in the evening; I have to speak with you upon business."</p>

<p>She answered, "I will, Sir." And her eyes swam with
delight, in expectation of the interview.</p>

<p>Let not the reader, nevertheless, imagine, there was in
that ardent expectation, one idea which the most spotless
mind, in love, might not have indulged without reproach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Sincere love (at least among the delicate of the female sex)
is often gratified by that degree of enjoyment, or rather
forbearance, which would be torture in the pursuit of any
other passion. Real, delicate, and restrained love, such as
Miss Milner's, was indulged in the sight of the object only;
and having bounded her wishes by her hopes, the height of
her happiness was limited to a conversation, in which no
other but themselves took a part.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was one of those who heard the appointment,
but the only one who conceived with what sensation
it was received.</p>

<p>While the ladies remained in the same room with Dorriforth,
Miss Milner thought of little, except of him. As soon
as they withdrew into another apartment, she remembered
Miss Woodley; and turning her head suddenly, saw her
friend's face imprinted with suspicion and displeasure: this
at first was painful to her&mdash;but recollecting that in a couple
of hours she was to meet her guardian alone&mdash;to speak to him,
and hear him speak to her only&mdash;every other thought was
absorbed in that one, and she considered with indifference,
the uneasiness, or the anger of her friend.</p>

<p>Miss Milner, to do justice to her heart, did not wish to
beguile Dorriforth into the snares of love: could any supernatural
power have endowed her with the means, and at the
same time have shewn to her the ills that must arise from
such an effect of her charms, she had assuredly virtue enough
to have declined the conquest; but without enquiring what
she proposed, she never saw him, without previously endeavouring
to look more attractive, than she would have
desired, before any other person. And now, without listening
to the thousand exhortations that spoke in every feature
of Miss Woodley, she flew to a looking-glass, to adjust her
dress in a manner that she thought most enchanting.</p>

<p>Time stole away, and the time of going to her guardian
arrived. In his presence, unsupported by the presence of
any other, every grace that she had practised, every look that
she had borrowed to set off her charms, were annihilated;
and she became a native beauty, with the artless arguments
of reason only for her aid. Awed thus by his power, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
every thing but what she really was, she never was perhaps
half so bewitching, as in those timid, respectful, and embarrassed
moments she passed alone with him. He caught at
those times her respect, her diffidence, nay, even her embarrassment;
and never would one word of anger pass on
either side.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, he first expressed the high satisfaction
that she had given him, by at length revealing to him
the real state of her mind.</p>

<p>"And when I take every thing into consideration, Miss
Milner," added he, "I rejoice that your sentiments happen
to be such as you have owned. For, although my Lord
Frederick is not the very man I could have wished for your
perfect happiness; yet, in the state of human perfection
and human happiness, you might have fixed your affections
with perhaps less propriety; and still, where my unwillingness
to thwart your inclinations might not have permitted
me to contend with them."</p>

<p>Not a word of reply did this demand; or if it had, not
a word could she have given.</p>

<p>"And now, Madam, the reason of my desire to speak
with you&mdash;is, to know the means you think most proper to
pursue, in order to acquaint Lord Frederick, that notwithstanding
this late repulse, there are hopes of your partiality
in his favour."</p>

<p>"Defer the explanation," she replied eagerly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;it cannot be. Besides, how can you
indulge a disposition thus unpitying? Even so ardently did
I desire to render the man who loves you happy, that though
he came armed against my life, had I not reflected, that
previous to our engagement it would appear like fear, and
the means of bartering for his forgiveness, I should have
revealed your sentiments the moment I had seen him. When
the engagement was over, I was too impatient to acquaint
you with his safety, to think then on gratifying him. And
indeed, the delicacy of the declaration, after the many
denials which you have no doubt given him, should be
considered. I therefore consult your opinion upon the
manner in which it shall be made."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Dorriforth, can you allow nothing to the moments
of surprise, and that pity, which the fate impending inspired?
and which might urge me to express myself of Lord Frederick,
in a manner my cooler thoughts will not warrant?"</p>

<p>"There was nothing in your expressions, my dear Miss
Milner, the least equivocal&mdash;if you were off your guard
when you pleaded for Lord Frederick, as I believe you were,
you said more sincerely what you thought; and no discreet,
or rather indiscreet attempts to retract, can make me change
these sentiments."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she replied, confused and trembling.</p>

<p>"Why sorry? Come give me commission to reveal your
partiality. I'll not be too hard upon you&mdash;a hint from me
will do. Hope is ever apt to interpret the slightest words
to its own use, and a lover's hope is beyond all others,
sanguine."</p>

<p>"I never gave Lord Frederick hope."</p>

<p>"But you never plunged him into despair."</p>

<p>"His pursuit intimates that I never have, but he has no
other proof."</p>

<p>"However light and frivolous you have been upon frivolous
subjects, yet I must own, Miss Milner, that I did expect
when a case of this importance came seriously before you,
you would have discovered a proper stability in your behaviour."</p>

<p>"I do, Sir; and it was only when I was affected with
a weakness, which arose from accident, that I have betrayed
inconsistency."</p>

<p>"You then assert again, that you have no affection for
my Lord Frederick?"</p>

<p>"Not enough to become his wife."</p>

<p>"You are alarmed at marriage, and I do not wonder you
should be so; it shews a prudent foresight which does you
honour&mdash;but, my dear, are there no dangers in a single
state? If I may judge, Miss Milner, there are many more
to a young lady of your accomplishments, than if you were
under the protection of a husband."</p>

<p>"My father, Mr. Dorriforth, thought your protection
sufficient."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that protection was rather to direct your choice,
than to be the cause of your not choosing at all. Give me
leave to point out an observation which, perhaps, I have
too frequently made before, but upon this occasion I must
intrude it once again. Miss Fenton is its object&mdash;her
fortune is inferior to your's, her personal attractions are
less"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here the powerful glow of joy, and of gratitude, for an
opinion so negligently, and yet so sincerely expressed, flew
to Miss Milner's face, neck, and even to her hands and
fingers; the blood mounted to every part of her skin that
was visible, for not a fibre but felt the secret transport,
that Dorriforth thought her more beautiful than the beautiful
Miss Fenton.</p>

<p>If he observed her blushes, he was unsuspicious of the
cause, and went on.</p>

<p>"There is, besides, in the temper of Miss Fenton, a sedateness
that might with less hazard ensure her safety in an
unmarried life; and yet she very properly thinks it her
duty, as she does not mean to seclude herself by any vows
to the contrary, to become a wife&mdash;and in obedience to the
counsel of her friends, will be married within a very few
weeks."</p>

<p>"Miss Fenton may marry from obedience, I never will."</p>

<p>"You mean to say, that love shall alone induce you."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"If you would point out a subject upon which I am the
least able to reason, and on which my sentiments, such as
they are, are formed only from theory, (and even there,
more cautioned than instructed) it is the subject of love.
And yet, even that little which I know, tells me, without
a doubt, that what you said yesterday, pleading for Lord
Frederick's life, was the result of the most violent and
tender love."</p>

<p>"The <i>little you know</i> then, Mr. Dorriforth, has deceived
you; had you <i>known more</i>, you would have judged otherwise."</p>

<p>"I submit to the merit of your reply; but without
allowing me a judge at all, I will appeal to those who were
present with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are Mrs. Horton and Mr. Sandford to be the connoisseurs?"</p>

<p>"No; I'll appeal to Miss Fenton and Miss Woodley."</p>

<p>"And yet, I believe," replied she with a smile, "I believe
theory must only be the judge even there."</p>

<p>"Then from all you have said, Madam, on this occasion,
I am to conclude that you still refuse to marry Lord
Frederick?"</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"And you submit never to see him again?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"All you then said to me, yesterday, was false?"</p>

<p>"I was not mistress of myself at the time."</p>

<p>"Therefore it was truth!&mdash;for shame, for shame!"</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and Mr. Sandford
walked in&mdash;he started back on seeing Miss Milner, and was
going away; but Dorriforth called to him to stay, and said
with warmth,</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Sandford, by what power, by what persuasion,
I can prevail upon Miss Milner to confide in me
as her friend; to lay her heart open, and credit mine
when I declare to her, that I have no view in all the advice
I give to her, but her immediate welfare."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dorriforth, you know my opinion of that lady,"
replied Sandford; "it has been formed ever since my first
acquaintance with her, and it continues the same."</p>

<p>"But instruct me how I am to inspire her with confidence,"
returned Dorriforth; "how I am to impress her with
a sense of that, which is for her advantage?"</p>

<p>"You can work no miracles," replied Sandford, "you are
not holy enough."</p>

<p>"And yet my ward," answered Dorriforth, "appears to
be acquainted with that mystery; for what but the force of
a miracle can induce her to contradict to-day, what before
you, and several other witnesses, she positively acknowledged
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Do you call that miraculous?" cried Sandford; "the
miracle had been if she had <i>not</i> done so&mdash;for did she not
yesterday contradict what she acknowledged the day before?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and will she not to-morrow disavow what she says to-day?"</p>

<p>"I wish that she may&mdash;" replied Dorriforth mildly, for
he saw the tears flowing down her face at the rough and
severe manner in which Sandford had spoken, and he began
to feel for her uneasiness.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," cried Sandford, "for speaking so rudely
to the mistress of the house&mdash;I have no business here, I know;
but where <i>you</i> are, Mr. Dorriforth, unless I am turned out,
I shall always think it my duty to come."</p>

<p>Miss Milner curtsied, as much as to say, he was welcome
to come. He continued,</p>

<p>"I was to blame, that upon a nice punctilio, I left you so
long without my visits, and without my counsel; in that
time, you have run the hazard of being murdered, and what
is worse, of being excommunicated; for had you been so
rash as to have returned your opponent's fire, not all my
interest at Rome would have obtained remission of the
punishment."</p>

<p>Miss Milner, through all her tears, could not now restrain
her laughter. On which he resumed;</p>

<p>"And here do I venture, like a missionary among savages&mdash;but
if I can only save you from their scalping knives&mdash;from
the miseries which that lady is preparing for you, I am
rewarded."</p>

<p>Sandford spoke this with great fervour, and the offence of
her love never appeared to her in so tremendous a point of
view, as when thus, unknowingly, alluded to by him.</p>

<p>"<i>The miseries that lady is preparing for you</i>," hung upon
her ears like the notes of a raven, and sounded equally
ominous. The words "<i>murder</i>" and "<i>excommunication</i>"
he had likewise uttered; all the fatal effects of sacrilegious
love. Frightful superstitions struck her to the heart, and she
could scarcely prevent falling down under their oppression.</p>

<p>Dorriforth beheld the difficulty she had in sustaining herself,
and with the utmost tenderness went towards her, and
supporting her, said, "I beg your pardon&mdash;I invited you
hither with a far different intention than your uneasiness,
and be assured&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandford was beginning to speak, when Dorriforth resumed,&mdash;"Hold,
Mr. Sandford, the lady is under my protection,
and I know not whether it is not requisite that you
should apologize to her, and to me, for what you have already
said."</p>

<p>"You asked my opinion, or I had not given it you&mdash;would
you have me, like <i>her</i>, speak what I do not think?"</p>

<p>"Say no more, Sir," cried Dorriforth&mdash;and leading her
kindly to the door, as if to defend her from his malice, told
her, "He would take another opportunity of renewing the
subject."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When Dorriforth was alone with Sandford, he explained
to him what before he had only hinted; and this learned
Jesuit frankly confessed, "That the mind of woman was
far above, or rather beneath, his comprehension." It was
so, indeed&mdash;for with all his penetration, and few even of
that school had more, he had not yet penetrated into the
recesses of Miss Milner's heart.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, to whom she repeated all that had passed
between herself, her guardian, and Sandford, took this
moment, in the agitation of her spirits, to alarm her still
more by prophetic insinuations; and at length represented
to her here, for the first time, the necessity, "That Mr. Dorriforth
and she no longer should remain under the same roof."
This was like the stroke of sudden death to Miss Milner, and
clinging to life, she endeavoured to avert the blow by prayers,
and by promises. Her friend loved her too sincerely to be
prevailed upon.</p>

<p>"But in what manner can I accomplish the separation?"
cried she, "for till I marry we are obliged, by my father's
request, to live in the same house."</p>

<p>"Miss Milner," answered Miss Woodley, "much as I
respect the will of a dying man, I regard your and Mr. Dorriforth's
present and eternal happiness much more; and it is
my resolution that you <i>shall part</i>. If <i>you</i> will not contrive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the means, that duty falls on me, and without any invention
I see the measure at once."</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Miss Milner eagerly.</p>

<p>"I will reveal to Mr. Dorriforth, without hesitation, the
real state of your heart; which your present inconsistency
of conduct will but too readily confirm."</p>

<p>"You would not plunge me into so much shame, into so
much anguish!" cried she, distractedly.</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Woodley, "not for the world, if you
will separate from him by any mode of your own&mdash;but that
you <i>shall</i> separate is my determination; and in spite of all
your sufferings, this shall be the expedient, unless you
instantly agree to some other."</p>

<p>"Good Heaven, Miss Woodley! is this your friendship?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and the truest friendship I have to bestow. Think
what a task I undertake for your sake and his, when I condemn
myself to explain to him your weakness. What
astonishment! what confusion! what remorse, do I foresee
painted upon his face! I hear him call you by the harshest
names, and behold him fly from your sight for ever, as an
object of his detestation."</p>

<p>"Oh spare the dreadful picture.&mdash;Fly from my sight for
ever! Detest my name! Oh! my dear Miss Woodley, let
but his friendship for me still remain, and I will consent to
any thing. You may command me. I will go away from
him directly&mdash;but let us part in friendship&mdash;Oh! without
the friendship of Mr. Dorriforth, life would be a heavy
burthen indeed."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley immediately began to contrive schemes
for their separation; and, with all her invention alive on the
subject, the following was the only natural one that she could
form.</p>

<p>Miss Milner, in a letter to her distant relation at Bath,
was to complain of the melancholy of a country life, which
she was to say her guardian imposed upon her; and she was
to entreat the lady to send a pressing invitation that she
would pass a month or two at her house; this invitation
was to be laid before Dorriforth for his approbation,
and the two ladies were to enforce it, by expressing their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
earnest wishes for his consent. This plan having been
properly regulated, the necessary letter was sent to Bath,
and Miss Woodley waited with patience, but with a watchful
guard upon the conduct of her friend, till the answer should
arrive.</p>

<p>During this interim a tender and complaining epistle from
Lord Frederick was delivered to Miss Milner; to which,
as he received no answer, he prevailed upon his uncle, with
whom he resided, to wait upon her, and obtain a verbal
reply; for he still flattered himself, that fear of her guardian's
anger, or perhaps his interception of the letter which he had
sent, was the sole cause of her apparent indifference.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was introduced both to Miss Milner
and to Mr. Dorriforth, but received from each an answer
so explicit, that left his nephew no longer in doubt but that
all farther pursuit was vain.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Ashton about this time also submitted to
a formal dismission; and had the mortification to reflect,
that he was bestowing upon the object of his affections, the
tenderest proof of his regard, by absenting himself entirely
from her society.</p>

<p>Upon this serious and certain conclusion to the hopes of
Lord Frederick, Dorriforth was more astonished than ever
at the conduct of his ward. He had once thought her
behaviour in this respect was ambiguous, but since her
confession of a passion for that nobleman, he had no doubt
but in the end she would become his wife. He lamented
to find himself mistaken, and thought it proper now to
condemn her caprice, not merely in words, but in the
general tenor of his behaviour. He consequently became
more reserved, and more austere than he had been since his
first acquaintance with her; for his manners, not from
design, but imperceptibly to himself, had been softened
since he became her guardian, by that tender respect which
he had uniformly paid to the object of his protection.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the severity he now assumed, his ward,
in the prospect of parting from him, grew melancholy; Miss
Woodley's love to her friend rendered her little otherwise;
and Dorriforth's peculiar gravity, frequently rigour, could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
not but make their whole party less cheerful than it had been.
Lord Elmwood too, at this time was lying dangerously ill
of a fever; Miss Fenton of course was as much in sorrow
as her nature would permit her to be, and both Sandford and
Dorriforth in extreme concern upon his Lordship's account.</p>

<p>In this posture of affairs, the letter of invitation arrives
from Lady Luneham at Bath; it was shewn to Dorriforth;
and to prove to his ward that he is so much offended, as no
longer to feel that excessive interest in her concerns which
he once felt, he gives an opinion on the subject with indifference&mdash;he
desires "Miss Milner will do what she herself
thinks proper." Miss Woodley instantly accepts this permission,
writes back, and appoints the day upon which her
friend means to set off for the visit.</p>

<p>Miss Milner is wounded at the heart by the cold and
unkind manners of her guardian, but dares not take one step
to retrieve his opinion. Alone, or to her friend, she sighs
and weeps: he discovers her sorrow, and is doubtful whether
the departure of Lord Frederick from that part of the
country is not the cause.</p>

<p>When the time she was to set out for Bath was only two
days off, the behaviour of Dorriforth took, by degrees, its
usual form, if not a greater share of polite and tender attention
than ever. It was the first time he had parted from
Miss Milner since he became her guardian, and he felt upon
the occasion, a reluctance. He had been angry with her,
he had shewn her that he was, and he now began to wish
that he had not. She is not happy, (he considered within
himself) every word and action declares she is not; I may
have been too severe, and added perhaps to her uneasiness.
"At least we will part on good terms," said he&mdash;"Indeed, my
regard for her is such, I cannot part otherwise."</p>

<p>She soon discerned his returning kindness, and it was
a gentle tie that would have fastened her to that spot for
ever, but for the firm resistance of Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"What will the absence of a few months effect?" said
she, pleading her own cause; "At the end of a few months
at farthest, he will expect me back, and where then will be the
merit of this separation?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that time," replied Miss Woodley, "we may find
some method to make it longer." To this she listened with
a kind of despair, but uttered, she "Was resigned,"&mdash;and
she prepared for her departure.</p>

<p>Dorriforth was all anxiety that every circumstance of her
journey should be commodious; he was eager she should
be happy; and he was eager she should see that he entirely
forgave her. He would have gone part of the way with her,
but for the extreme illness of Lord Elmwood, in whose
chamber he passed most of the day, and slept in Elmwood
House every night.</p>

<p>On the morning of her journey, when Dorriforth gave
his hand and conducted Miss Milner to the carriage, all the
way he led her she could not restrain her tears; which
increased, as he parted from her, to convulsive sobs. He was
affected by her grief; and though he had previously bid her
farewell, he drew her gently on one side, and said, with the
tenderest concern,</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Milner, we part friends?&mdash;I hope we do?&mdash;On
my side, depend upon it, that I regret nothing so much
at our separation, as having ever given you a moment's pain."</p>

<p>"I believe so," was all she could utter, for she hastened
from him, lest his discerning eye should discover the cause
of the weakness which thus overcame her. But her apprehensions
were groundless; the rectitude of his own heart was
a bar to the suspicion of her's. He once more kindly bade
her adieu, and the carriage drove away.</p>

<p>Miss Fenton and Miss Woodley accompanied her part of
the journey, about thirty miles, where they were met by
Sir Harry and Lady Luneham. Here was a parting nearly
as affecting as that between her and her guardian. Miss
Woodley, who for several weeks had treated her friend with
a rigidness she herself hardly supposed was in her nature,
now bewailed that she had done so; implored her forgiveness;
promised to correspond with her punctually, and to
omit no opportunity of giving her every consolation short
of cherishing her fatal passion&mdash;but in that, and that only,
was the heart of Miss Milner to be consoled.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When Miss Milner arrived at Bath, she thought it the
most altered place she had ever seen&mdash;she was mistaken&mdash;it
was herself that was changed.</p>

<p>The walks were melancholy, the company insipid, the
ball-room fatiguing&mdash;for, she had left behind all that could
charm or please her.</p>

<p>Though she found herself much less happy than when she
was at Bath before, yet she felt, that she would not, even to
enjoy all that past happiness, be again reduced to the being
she was at that period. Thus does the lover consider the
extinction of his passion with the same horror as the libertine
looks upon annihilation; the one would rather live hereafter,
though in all the tortures described as constituting
his future state, than cease to exist; so, there are no tortures
which a lover would not suffer, rather than cease to love.</p>

<p>In the wide prospect of sadness before her, Miss Milner's
fancy caught hold of the only comfort which presented
itself; and this, faint as it was, in the total absence of every
other, her imagination painted to her as excessive. The
comfort was a letter from Miss Woodley&mdash;a letter, in which
the subject of her love would most assuredly be mentioned,
and in whatever terms, it would still be the means of delight.</p>

<p>A letter arrived&mdash;she devoured it with her eyes. The
post mark denoting from whence it came, the name of
"Milner Lodge" written on the top, were all sources of
pleasure&mdash;and she read slowly every line it contained, to
procrastinate the pleasing expectation she enjoyed, till she
should arrive at the name of Dorriforth. At last, her impatient
eye caught the word, three lines beyond the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
she was reading&mdash;irresistibly, she skipped over those lines,
and fixed on the point to which she was attracted.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was cautious in her indulgence; she made
the slightest mention of Dorriforth; saying only, "He was
extremely concerned, and even dejected, at the little hope
there was of his cousin, Lord Elmwood's, recovery." Short
and trivial as this passage was, it was still more important to
Miss Milner than any other in the letter&mdash;she read it again
and again, considered, and reflected upon it. Dejected,
thought she, what does that word exactly mean?&mdash;did I ever
see Mr. Dorriforth dejected?&mdash;how, I wonder, does he look in
that state? Thus did she muse, while the cause of his dejection,
though a most serious one, and pathetically described
by Miss Woodley, scarce arrested her attention once. She
ran over with haste the account of Lord Elmwood's state of
health; she certainly pitied him while she thought of him,
but she did not think of him long. To die, was a hard
fate for a young nobleman just in possession of his immense
fortune, and on the eve of marriage with a beautiful young
woman; but Miss Milner thought that an abode in Heaven
might be still better than all this, and she had no doubt but
his Lordship would go thither. The forlorn state of Miss
Fenton ought to have been a subject for compassion, but
she knew that lady had resignation to bear any lot with
patience, and that a trial of her fortitude might be more
flattering to her vanity than to be Countess of Elmwood: in
a word, she saw no one's misfortunes equal to her own,
because she saw no one so little able to bear misfortune.</p>

<p>She replied to Miss Woodley's letter, and dwelt very long
on that subject which her friend had passed over lightly;
this was another indulgence; and this epistolary intercourse
was now the only enjoyment she possessed. From Bath
she paid several visits with Lady Luneham&mdash;all were alike
tedious and melancholy.</p>

<p>But her guardian wrote to her, and though it was on
a topic of sorrow, the letter gave her joy&mdash;the sentiments it
expressed were merely common-place, yet she valued them
as the dearest effusions of friendship and affection; and her
hands trembled, and her heart beat with rapture while she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
wrote the answer, though she knew it would not be received
by him with one emotion like those which she experienced.
In her second letter to Miss Woodley, she prayed like a
person insane to be taken home from confinement, and like
a lunatic protested, in sensible language, she "Had no
disorder." But her friend replied, "That very declaration
proves its violence." And she assured her, nothing less than
placing her affections elsewhere, should induce her to believe
but that she was incurable.</p>

<p>The third letter from Milner Lodge brought the news of
Lord Elmwood's death. Miss Woodley was exceedingly
affected by this event, and said little else on any other subject.
Miss Milner was shocked when she read the words "He is
dead", and instantly thought,</p>

<p>"How transient are all sublunary things! Within a few
years <i>I</i> shall be dead&mdash;and how happy will it then be, if
I have resisted every temptation to the alluring pleasures
of this life!" The happiness of a peaceful death occupied
her contemplation for near an hour; but at length, every
virtuous and pious sentiment this meditation inspired,
served but to remind her of the many sentences she had
heard from her guardian's lips upon the same subject&mdash;her
thoughts were again fixed on him, and she could think of
nothing besides.</p>

<p>In a short time after this, her health became impaired
from the indisposition of her mind; she languished, and was
once in imminent danger. During a slight delirium of her
fever, Miss Woodley's name and her guardian's were incessantly
repeated; Lady Luneham sent them immediate word
of this, and they both hastened to Bath, and arrived there
just as the violence and danger of her disorder had ceased.
As soon as she became perfectly recollected, her first care,
knowing the frailty of her heart, was to enquire what she
had uttered while delirious. Miss Woodley, who was by her
bedside, begged her not to be alarmed on that account,
and assured her she knew, from all her attendants, that she had
only spoken with a friendly remembrance (as was really the
case) of those persons who were dear to her.</p>

<p>She wished to know whether her guardian was come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
see her, but she had not the courage to ask before her
friend; and she in her turn was afraid by the too sudden
mention of his name, to discompose her. Her maid, however,
after some little time, entered the chamber, and
whispered Miss Woodley. Miss Milner asked inquisitively
"What she said?"</p>

<p>The maid replied softly, "Lord Elmwood, Madam, wishes
to come and see you for a few moments, if you will allow
him."</p>

<p>At this reply Miss Milner stared wildly.</p>

<p>"I thought," said she, "I thought Lord Elmwood had
been dead&mdash;are my senses disordered still?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear," answered Miss Woodley, "it is the present
Lord Elmwood who wishes to see you; he whom you left
ill when you came hither, <i>is</i> dead."</p>

<p>"And who is the present Lord Elmwood?" she asked.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, after a short hesitation, replied&mdash;"Your
guardian."</p>

<p>"And so he is," cried Miss Milner; "he is the next heir&mdash;I
had forgot. But is it possible that he is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;" returned Miss Woodley with a grave voice and
manner, to moderate that glow of satisfaction which for
a moment sparkled even in her languid eye, and blushed over
her pallid countenance. "Yes&mdash;as he heard you were ill,
he thought it right to come and see you."</p>

<p>"He is very good," she answered, and the tear started in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Would you please to see his Lordship?" asked her maid.</p>

<p>"Not yet, not yet," she replied; "let me recollect myself
first." And she looked with a timid doubt upon her friend,
to ask if it was proper.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley could hardly support this humble reference
to her judgment, from the wan face of the poor invalid, and
taking her by the hand, whispered, "You shall do what you
please." In a few minutes Lord Elmwood was introduced.</p>

<p>To those who sincerely love, every change of situation or
circumstances in the object beloved, appears an advantage.
So, the acquisition of a title and estate was, in Miss Milner's
eye, an inestimable advantage to her guardian; not on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
account of their real value; but that any change, instead of
diminishing her passion, would have served only to increase
it&mdash;even a change to the utmost poverty.</p>

<p>When he entered&mdash;the sight of him seemed to be too
much for her, and after the first glance she turned her head
away. The sound of his voice encouraged her to look once
more&mdash;and then she riveted her eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, my dear Miss Milner," he gently
whispered, "to say, what joy I feel that your disorder has
subsided."</p>

<p>But though it was impossible to say, it was possible to
<i>look</i> what he felt, and his looks expressed his feelings. In
the zeal of those sensations, he laid hold of her hand, and
held it between his&mdash;this he did not himself know&mdash;but
she did.</p>

<p>"You have prayed for me, my Lord, I make no doubt?"
said she, and smiled, as if thanking him for those prayers.</p>

<p>"Fervently, ardently!" returned he; and the fervency
with which he had prayed spoke in every feature.</p>

<p>"But I am a protestant, you know, and if I had died such,
do you believe I should have gone to Heaven?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, that would not have prevented you."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Sandford does not think so."</p>

<p>"He must; for he means to go there himself."</p>

<p>To keep her guardian with her, Miss Milner seemed
inclined to converse; but her solicitous friend gave Lord
Elmwood a look, which implied that it might be injurious
to her, and he retired.</p>

<p>They had only one more interview before he left the place;
at which Miss Milner was capable of sitting up&mdash;he was with
her, however, but a very short time, some necessary concerns
relative to his late kinsman's affairs, calling him in haste to
London. Miss Woodley continued with her friend till she
saw her entirely reinstated in her health: during which
time her guardian was frequently the subject of their private
conversation; and upon those occasions Miss Milner has
sometimes brought Miss Woodley to acknowledge, "That
could Mr. Dorriforth have possibly foreseen the early death
of the last Lord Elmwood, it had been more for the honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of his religion (as that ancient title would now after him
become extinct), if he had preferred marriage vows to those
of celibacy."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When the time for Miss Woodley's departure arrived,
Miss Milner entreated earnestly to accompany her home, and
made the most solemn promises that she would guard not
only her behaviour, but her very thoughts, within the
limitation her friend should prescribe. Miss Woodley at
length yielded thus far, "That as soon as Lord Elmwood
was set out on his journey to Italy, where she had heard him
say that he should soon be obliged to go, she would no
longer deny her the pleasure of returning; and if (after the
long absence which must consequently take place between
him and her) she could positively affirm the suppression of
her passion was the happy result, she would then take her
word, and risk the danger of seeing them once more reside
together."</p>

<p>This concession having been obtained, they parted; and
as winter was now far advanced, Miss Woodley returned to
her aunt's house in town, from whence Mrs. Horton was,
however, preparing to remove, in order to superintend Lord
Elmwood's house, (which had been occupied by the late
Earl,) in Grosvenor Square; and her niece was to accompany
her.</p>

<p>If Lord Elmwood was not desirous Miss Milner should
conclude her visit and return to his protection, it was partly
from the multiplicity of affairs in which he was at this time
engaged, and partly from having Mr. Sandford now entirely
placed with him as his chaplain; for he dreaded, that living
in the same house, their natural antipathy might be increased
even to aversion. Upon this account, he once thought of
advising Mr. Sandford to take up his abode elsewhere; but
the great pleasure he took in his society, joined to the bitter
mortification he knew such a proposal would be to his friend,
would not suffer him to make it.</p>

<p>Miss Milner all this time was not thinking upon those she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
hated, but on those she loved. Sandford never came into
her thoughts, while the image of Lord Elmwood never left
them. One morning, as she sat talking to Lady Luneham
on various subjects, but thinking alone on him, Sir Harry
Luneham, with another gentleman, a Mr. Fleetmond, came
in, and the conversation turned upon the improbability,
during the present Lord Elmwood's youth, that he should
ever inherit the title and estate which had now fallen to him&mdash;and,
said Mr. Fleetmond, "Independent of rank and
fortune, it must be matter of infinite joy to Mr. Dorriforth."</p>

<p>"No," answered Sir Harry, "independent of rank and
fortune, it must be a motive of concern to him; for he must
now regret, beyond measure, his folly in taking priest's orders,
thus depriving himself of the hopes of an heir, so that his
title, at his death, will be lost."</p>

<p>"By no means," replied Mr. Fleetmond; "he may yet
have an heir, for he will certainly marry."</p>

<p>"Marry!" cried the Baronet.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the other, "it was that I meant by the
joy it might probably give him, beyond the possession of
his estate and title."</p>

<p>"How he married?" said Lady Luneham, "Has he not
taken a vow never to marry?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Fleetmond, "but there are no
<i>religious</i> vows, from which the sovereign Pontiff at Rome
cannot grant a dispensation, as those commandments which
are made by the church, the church has always the power
to revoke; and when it is for the general good of religion,
his Holiness thinks it incumbent on him, to publish his bull,
and remit all penalties for their non-observance; and
certainly it is for the honour of the Catholics, that this
Earldom should continue in a Catholic family. In short,
I'll venture to lay a wager, my Lord Elmwood is married
within a year."</p>

<p>Miss Milner, who listened with attention, feared she was
in a dream, or deceived by the pretended knowledge of
Mr. Fleetmond, who might know nothing&mdash;yet all that he
had said was very probable; and he was himself a Roman
Catholic, so that he must be well informed on the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
upon which he spoke. If she had heard the direst news
that ever sounded in the ears of the most susceptible of
mortals, the agitation of her mind and person could not
have been stronger&mdash;she felt, while every word was speaking,
a chill through all her veins&mdash;a pleasure too exquisite, not
to bear along with it the sensation of exquisite pain; of
which she was so sensible, that for a few moments it made
her wish that she had not heard the intelligence; though,
very soon after, she would not but have heard it for the
world.</p>

<p>As soon as she had recovered from her first astonishment
and joy, she wrote to Miss Woodley an exact account of what
she had heard, and received this answer:</p>

<p>"I am sorry any body should have given you this piece of
information, because it was a task, in executing which, I had
promised myself extreme satisfaction&mdash;but from the fear that
your health was not yet strong enough to support, without
some danger, the burthen of hopes which I knew would, upon
this occasion, press upon you, I deferred my communication
and it has been anticipated. Yet, as you seem in doubt as
to the reality of what you have been told, perhaps this confirmation
of it may fall very little short of the first news;
especially when it is enforced by my request, that you will
come to us, as soon as you can with propriety leave Lady
Luneham.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear Miss Milner, and find in your once rigid
monitor a faithful confidante. I will no longer threaten to
disclose a secret you have trusted me with, but leave it to the
wisdom, or sensibility of <i>his</i> heart, (who is now to penetrate
into the hearts of our sex, in search of one that may beat
in unison with his own) to find it out. I no longer condemn,
but congratulate you on your passion; and will assist you
with all my advice and my earnest wishes, that it may obtain
a return."</p>

<p>This letter was another of those excruciating pleasures,
that almost reduced Miss Milner to the grave. Her appetite
forsook her; and she vainly endeavoured, for several nights,
to close her eyes. She thought so much upon the prospect
of accomplishing her wishes, that she could admit no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
idea; nor even invent one probable excuse for leaving Lady
Luneham before the appointed time, which was then at the
distance of two months. She wrote to Miss Woodley to beg
her contrivance, to reproach her for keeping the secret so
long from her, and to thank her for having revealed it in so
kind a manner at last. She begged also to be acquainted
how Mr. Dorriforth (for still she called him by that name)
spoke and thought of this sudden change in his destiny.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley's reply was a summons for her to town
upon some pretended business, which she avoided explaining,
but which entirely silenced Lady Luneham's entreaties for
her stay.</p>

<p>To her question concerning Lord Elmwood she answered,
"It is a subject on which he seldom speaks&mdash;he appears just
the same he ever did, nor could you by any part of his conduct,
conceive that any such change had taken place." Miss
Milner exclaimed to herself, "I am glad he is not altered&mdash;if
his words, looks, or manners, were any thing different from
what they formerly were, I should not like him so well."
And just the reverse would have been the case, had Miss
Woodley sent her word he was changed. The day for
her leaving Bath was fixed; she expected it with rapture,
but before its arrival, sunk under the care of expectation;
and when it came, was so much indisposed, as to be obliged
to defer her journey for a week.</p>

<p>At length she found herself in London&mdash;in the house of
her guardian&mdash;and that guardian no longer bound to a single
life, but <i>enjoined</i> to marry. He appeared in her eyes, as in
Miss Woodley's, the same as ever; or perhaps more endearing
than ever, as it was the first time she had beheld him with
hope. Mr. Sandford did <i>not</i> appear the same; yet he was
in reality as surly and as disrespectful in his behaviour to her
as usual; but she did not observe, or she did not feel his
morose temper as heretofore&mdash;he seemed amiable, mild, and
gentle; at least this was the happy medium through which
her self-complacent mind began to see him; for good
humour, like the jaundice, makes every one of its own
complexion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="II_CHAPTER_III" id="II_CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Lord Elmwood was preparing to go abroad, for the purpose
of receiving in form, the dispensation from his vows;
it was, however, a subject he seemed carefully to avoid
speaking upon; and when by any accident he was obliged
to mention it, it was without any marks either of satisfaction
or concern.</p>

<p>Miss Milner's pride began to be alarmed. While he was
Mr. Dorriforth, and confined to a single life, his indifference
to her charms was rather an honourable than a reproachful
trait in his character, and in reality, she admired him for the
insensibility. But on the eve of being at liberty, and on the
eve of making his choice, she was offended <i>that</i> choice was
not immediately fixed upon her. She had been accustomed
to receive the devotion of every man who saw her, and not to
obtain it of the man from whom, of all others, she most
wished it, was cruelly humiliating. She complained to Miss
Woodley, who advised her to have patience; but that was
one of the virtues in which she was the least practised.</p>

<p>Encouraged, nevertheless, by her friend in the commendable
desire of gaining the affections of him, who possessed all
her own, she, however, left no means unattempted for the
conquest&mdash;but she began with too great a certainty of
success, not to be sensible of the deepest mortification in the
disappointment&mdash;nay, she anticipated a disappointment, as
she had before anticipated her success; by turns feeling the
keenest emotions from hope and from despair.</p>

<p>As these passions alternately governed her, she was alternately
in spirits or dejected; in good or in ill humour; and
the vicissitudes of her prospect at length gave to her behaviour
an air of caprice, which not all her follies had till now produced.
This was not the way to secure the affections of
Lord Elmwood; she knew it was not; and before him she
was under some restriction. Sandford observed this, and
without reserve, added to the list of her other failings,
hypocrisy. It was plain to see that Mr. Sandford esteemed
her less and less every day; and as he was the person who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
most influenced the opinion of her guardian, he became to
her, very soon, an object not merely of dislike, but of abhorrence.</p>

<p>These mutual sentiments were discoverable in every word
and action, while they were in each other's company; but
still in his absence, Miss Milner's good nature, and total
freedom from malice, never suffered her to utter a sentence
injurious to his interest. Sandford's charity did not extend
thus far; and speaking of her with severity one evening while
she was at the opera, "His meaning," as he said, "but to
caution her guardian against her faults," Lord Elmwood
replied,</p>

<p>"There is one fault, however, Mr. Sandford, I cannot
lay to her charge."</p>

<p>"And what is that, my Lord?" cried Sandford, eagerly,
"What is that one fault, which Miss Milner has not?"</p>

<p>"I never," replied Lord Elmwood, "heard Miss Milner,
in your absence, utter a syllable to your disadvantage."</p>

<p>"She dares not, my Lord, because she is in fear of you
and she knows you would not suffer it."</p>

<p>"She then," answered his Lordship, "pays me a much
higher compliment than you do; for you freely censure
<i>her</i>, and yet imagine I <i>will</i> suffer it."</p>

<p>"My Lord," replied Sandford, "I am undeceived now,
and shall never take that liberty again."</p>

<p>As Lord Elmwood always treated Sandford with the
utmost respect, he began to fear he had been deficient upon
this occasion; and the disposition which had induced him
to take his ward's part, was likely, in the end, to prove
unfavourable to her; for perceiving Sandford was offended
at what had passed, as the only means of retribution, he
began himself to lament her volatile and captious propensities;
in which lamentation, Sandford, now forgetting his
affront, joined with the heartiest concurrence, adding,</p>

<p>"You, Sir, having now other cares to employ your thoughts,
ought to insist upon her marrying, or retiring into the
country."</p>

<p>She returned home just as this conversation was finished,
and Sandford, the moment she entered, rang for his candle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to retire. Miss Woodley, who had been at the opera with
Miss Milner, cried,</p>

<p>"Bless me, Mr. Sandford, are you not well, you are going
to leave us so early?"</p>

<p>He replied, "No, I have a pain in my head."</p>

<p>Miss Milner, who never listened to complaints without
sympathy, rose immediately from her seat, saying,</p>

<p>"I think I never heard you, Mr. Sandford, complain of
indisposition before. Will you accept of my specific for the
head-ache? Indeed it is a certain relief&mdash;I'll fetch it
instantly."</p>

<p>She went hastily out of the room, and returned with
a bottle, which, she assured him, "Was a present from
Lady Luneham, and would certainly cure him." And she
pressed it upon him with such an anxious earnestness, that
with all his churlishness he could not refuse taking it.</p>

<p>This was but a common-place civility, such as is paid by
one enemy to another every day; but the <i>manner</i> was the
material part. The unaffected concern, the attention, the
good will, she demonstrated in this little incident, was that
which made it remarkable, and immediately took from
Lord Elmwood the displeasure to which he had been just
before provoked, or rather transformed it into a degree of
admiration. Even Sandford was not insensible to her
behaviour, and in return, when he left the room, "Wished
her a good night."</p>

<p>To her and Miss Woodley, who had not been witnesses
of the preceding conversation, what she had done appeared
of no merit; but to the mind of Lord Elmwood, the merit
was infinite; and upon the departure of Sandford, he began
to be unusually cheerful. He first pleasantly reproached
the ladies for not offering him a place in their box at the
opera.</p>

<p>"Would you have gone, my Lord?" asked Miss Milner,
highly delighted.</p>

<p>"Certainly," returned he, "had you invited me."</p>

<p>"Then from this day I give you a general invitation; nor
shall any other company be admitted but those whom you
approve."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to you," said he.</p>

<p>"And you," continued she, "who have been accustomed
only to church-music, will be more than any one, enchanted
with hearing the softer music of love."</p>

<p>"What ravishing pleasures you are preparing for me!"
returned he&mdash;"I know not whether my weak senses will be
able to support them!"</p>

<p>She had her eyes upon him when he spoke this, and she
discovered in his, that were fixed upon her, a sensibility
unexpected&mdash;a kind of fascination which enticed her to look
on, while her eyelids fell involuntarily before its mighty
force, and a thousand blushes crowded over her face. He
was struck with these sudden signals; hastily recalled his
former countenance, and stopped the conversation.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, who had been a silent observer for some
time, now thought a word or two from her would be acceptable
rather than troublesome.</p>

<p>"And pray, my Lord," said she, "when do you go to
France?"</p>

<p>"To Italy you mean;&mdash;I shall not go at all," said he.
"My superiors are very indulgent, for they dispense with all
my duties. I ought, and I meant, to have gone abroad; but
as a variety of concerns require my presence in England, every
necessary ceremony has taken place here."</p>

<p>"Then your Lordship is no longer in orders?" said Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>"No; they have been resigned these five days."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I give you joy," said Miss Milner.</p>

<p>He thanked her, but added with a sigh, "If I have given
up content in search of joy, I shall perhaps be a loser by the
venture." Soon after this, he wished them a good night,
and retired.</p>

<p>Happy as Miss Milner found herself in his company, she
saw him leave the room with infinite satisfaction, because
her heart was impatient to give a loose to its hopes on the
bosom of Miss Woodley. She bade Mrs. Horton immediately
good night; and, in her friend's apartment, gave way
to all the language of passion, warmed with the confidence
of meeting its return. She described the sentiments she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
had read in Lord Elmwood's looks; and though Miss Woodley
had beheld them too, Miss Milner's fancy heightened the
expression of every glance, till her construction became, by
degrees, so extremely favourable to her own wishes, that had
not her friend been present, and known in what measure
to estimate those symptoms, she must infallibly have thought,
by the joy to which they gave birth, that he had openly
avowed a passion for her.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, therefore, thought it her duty to allay
these ecstasies, and represented to her, she might be deceived
in her hopes&mdash;or even supposing his wishes inclined towards
her, there were yet great obstacles between them.&mdash;"Would
not Sandford, who directed his every thought and purpose,
be consulted upon this? and if he was, upon what, but the
most romantic affection on the part of Lord Elmwood, had
Miss Milner to depend? and his Lordship was not a man to
be suspected of submitting to the excess of any passion."
Thus did Miss Woodley argue, lest her friend should be
misled by her wishes; yet, in her own mind, she scarce
harboured a doubt that any thing would thwart them.
The succeeding circumstance proved she was mistaken.</p>

<p>Another gentleman of family and fortune made overtures
to Miss Milner; and her guardian, so far from having his
thoughts inclined towards her on his own account, pleaded
this lover's cause even with more zeal than he had pleaded
for Sir Edward and Lord Frederick; thus at once destroying
all those plans of happiness which poor Miss Milner had
formed.</p>

<p>In consequence, her melancholy humour was now predominant;
she confined herself at home, and yet, by her own
order, was denied to all her visitors. Whether this arose
from pure melancholy, or the still lingering hope of making
her conquest, by that sedateness of manners which she knew
her guardian admired, she herself perhaps did not perfectly
know. Be that as it may, Lord Elmwood could not but
observe this change, and one morning thought fit to mention,
and to applaud it.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley and she were at work together when he
came into the room; and after sitting several minutes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
talking upon indifferent subjects, to which his ward replied
with a dejection in her voice and manner&mdash;he said,</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am wrong, Miss Milner, but I have observed
that you are lately more thoughtful than usual."</p>

<p>She blushed, as she always did when the subject was herself.
He continued, "Your health appears perfectly restored, and
yet I have observed you take no delight in your former
amusements."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry for that, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"No, I am extremely glad; and I was going to congratulate
you upon the change. But give me leave to enquire, to
what lucky accident we may attribute this alteration?"</p>

<p>"Your Lordship then thinks all my commendable deeds
arise from accident, and that I have no virtues of my own."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I think you have many." This he spoke
emphatically; and her blushes increased.</p>

<p>He resumed&mdash;"How can I doubt of a lady's virtues, when
her countenance gives me such evident proofs of them?
Believe me, Miss Milner, that in the midst of your gayest
follies, while you thus continue to blush, I shall reverence
your internal sensations."</p>

<p>"Oh! my Lord, did you know some of them, I am afraid
you would think them unpardonable."</p>

<p>This was so much to the purpose, that Miss Woodley
found herself alarmed&mdash;but without reason&mdash;Miss Milner
loved too sincerely to reveal it to the object. He answered,</p>

<p>"And did you know some of mine, you might think them
<i>equally</i> unpardonable."</p>

<p>She turned pale, and could no longer guide her needle&mdash;in
the fond transport of her heart she imagined that his
love for her, was among the sensations to which he alluded.
She was too much embarrassed to reply, and he continued,</p>

<p>"We have all much to pardon in one another: and
I know not whether the officious person who forces, even his
good advice, is not as blameable as the obstinate one, who
will not listen to it. And now, having made a preface to
excuse you, should you once more refuse mine, I shall venture
to give it."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I have never yet refused to follow your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
advice, but where my own peace of mind was so nearly concerned,
as to have made me culpable, had I complied."</p>

<p>"Well, Madam, I submit to your determinations; and
shall never again oppose your inclination to remain single."</p>

<p>This sentence, as it excluded the idea of soliciting for himself,
gave her the utmost pain; and her eye glanced at him,
full of reproach. He did not observe it, but went on.</p>

<p>"While you continue unmarried, it seems to have been
your father's intention that you should continue under my
immediate care; but as I mean for the future to reside
chiefly in the country&mdash;answer me candidly, do you think
you could be happy there, for at least three parts of the year?"</p>

<p>After a short hesitation, she replied, "I have no objection."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," he returned eagerly, "for it is my
earnest desire to have you with me&mdash;your welfare is dear to
me as my own; and were we apart, continual apprehensions
would prey upon my mind."</p>

<p>The tear started in her eye, at the earnestness that accompanied
these words; he saw it, and to soften her still more
with the sense of his esteem for her, he increased his earnestness
while he said,</p>

<p>"If you will take the resolution to quit London for the
time I mention, there shall be no means omitted to make the
country all you can wish&mdash;I shall insist upon Miss Woodley's
company for both our sakes; and it will not only be <i>my</i>
study to form such a society as you may approve, but I am
certain it will be likewise the study of Lady Elmwood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was going on, but as if a poniard had thrust her to the
heart, she writhed under this unexpected stroke.</p>

<p>He saw her countenance change&mdash;he looked at her steadfastly.</p>

<p>It was not a common change from joy to sorrow, from
content to uneasiness, which Miss Milner discovered&mdash;she
felt, and she expressed anguish&mdash;Lord Elmwood was alarmed
and shocked. She did not weep, but she called Miss Woodley
to come to her, with a voice that indicated a degree of agony.</p>

<p>"My Lord," (cried Miss Woodley, seeing his consternation
and trembling lest he should guess the secret,) "My Lord,
Miss Milner has again deceived you&mdash;you must not take her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from London&mdash;it is that, and that alone, which is the cause
of her uneasiness."</p>

<p>He seemed more amazed still&mdash;and still more shocked at
her duplicity than at her torture. "Good Heaven!" exclaimed
he, "How am I to accomplish her wishes? What
am I to do? How can I judge, if she will not confide in me,
but thus for ever deceive me?"</p>

<p>She leaned, pale as death, on the shoulder of Miss Woodley,
her eye fixed with apparent insensibility to all that was said,
while he continued,</p>

<p>"Heaven is my witness, if I knew&mdash;If I could conceive the
means how to make her happy, I would sacrifice my own
happiness to hers."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Miss Woodley with a smile, "perhaps I
may call upon you hereafter to fulfil your word."</p>

<p>He was totally ignorant what she meant, nor had he
leisure, from the confusion of his thoughts, to reflect upon
her meaning; he nevertheless replied, with warmth, "Do.
You shall find I'll perform it.&mdash;Do. I will faithfully perform
it."</p>

<p>Though Miss Milner was conscious this declaration could
not, in delicacy, be ever adduced against him; yet the
fervent and solemn manner in which he made it, cheered
her spirits; and as persons enjoy the reflection of having in
their possession some valuable gem, though they are determined
never to use it, so she upon this, was comforted and
grew better. She now lifted up her head, and leaned it on
her hand, as she sat by the side of a table&mdash;still she did not
speak, but seemed overcome with sorrow. As her situation
became, however, less alarming, her guardian's pity and
affright began to take the colour of resentment; and though
he did not say so, he was, and looked, highly offended.</p>

<p>At this juncture Mr. Sandford entered. On beholding
the present party, it required not his sagacity to see at the
first view, that they were all uneasy; but instead of the
sympathy this might have excited in some dispositions,
Mr. Sandford, after casting a look at each of them,
appeared in high spirits.</p>

<p>"You seem unhappy, my Lord," said he, with a smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do <i>not</i>&mdash;Mr. Sandford," Lord Elmwood replied.</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, nor would I, were I in your situation.
What should make a man of sense out of temper but a worthy
object!" And he looked at Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"There are no objects unworthy our care:" replied
Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"But there are objects on whom all care is fruitless, your
Lordship will allow."</p>

<p>"I never yet despaired of any one, Mr. Sandford."</p>

<p>"And yet there are persons, of whom it is presumption to
entertain hopes." And he looked again at Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"Does your head ache, Miss Milner?" asked her friend,
seeing her hold it with her hand.</p>

<p>"Very much," returned she.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford," said Miss Woodley, "did you use all those
drops Miss Milner gave you for a pain in the head?"</p>

<p>"Yes:" answered he, "I did." But the question at
that moment somewhat embarrassed him.</p>

<p>"And I hope you found benefit from them:" said Miss
Milner, with great kindness, as she rose from her seat, and
walked slowly out of the room.</p>

<p>Though Miss Woodley followed her, so that Mr. Sandford
was left alone with Lord Elmwood, and might have continued
his unkind insinuations without one restraint, yet his
lips were closed for the present. He looked down on the
carpet&mdash;twitched himself upon his chair&mdash;and began to talk
of the weather.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="II_CHAPTER_IV" id="II_CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When the first transports of despair were past, Miss Milner
suffered herself to be once more in hope. She found there
were no other means to support her life; and to her comfort,
her friend was much less severe on the present occasion than
she expected. No engagement between mortals was, in Miss
Woodley's opinion, binding like that entered into with
heaven; and whatever vows Lord Elmwood had possibly
made to another, she justly supposed that no woman's love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
for him equalled Miss Milner's&mdash;it was prior to all others too;
that established her claim to contend at least for success;
and in a contention, what rival would not fall before her?</p>

<p>It was not difficult to guess who this rival was; or if they
were a little time in suspence, Miss Woodley soon arrived
at the certainty, by inquiring of Mr. Sandford; who, unsuspecting
why she asked, readily informed her the intended
Lady Elmwood was no other than Miss Fenton; and that
their marriage would be solemnized as soon as the mourning
for the late Lord Elmwood was over. This last intelligence
made Miss Woodley shudder&mdash;she repeated it, however, to
Miss Milner, word for word.</p>

<p>"Happy! happy woman!" exclaimed Miss Milner of
Miss Fenton; "she has received the first fond impulse of
his heart, and has had the transcendent happiness of teaching
him to love!"</p>

<p>"By no means," returned Miss Woodley, finding no other
suggestion likely to comfort her; "do not suppose that his
marriage is the result of love&mdash;it is no more than a duty,
a necessary arrangement, and this you may plainly see by
the wife on whom he has fixed. Miss Fenton was thought
a proper match for his cousin, and that same propriety has
transferred her to him."</p>

<p>It was easy to convince Miss Milner that all her friend
said was truth, for she wished it so. "And oh!" she
exclaimed, "could I but stimulate passion, against the cold influence
of propriety;&mdash;Do you think, my dear Miss Woodley,"
(and she looked with such begging eyes, it was impossible
not to answer as she wished,) "do you think it would be
unjust to Miss Fenton, were I to inspire her destined husband
with a passion which she may not have inspired, and which
I believe <i>she</i> cannot feel?"</p>

<p>Miss Woodley paused a minute, and then answered,
"No:"&mdash;but there was a hesitation in her manner of
delivery&mdash;she <i>did</i> say, "No:" but she looked as if she was
afraid she ought to have said "Yes." Miss Milner, however,
did not give her time to recall the word, or to alter
its meaning by adding others to it, but ran on eagerly, and
declared, "As that was her opinion, she would abide by it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and do all she could to supplant her rival." In order, nevertheless,
to justify this determination, and satisfy the conscience
of Miss Woodley, they both concluded that Miss
Fenton's heart was not engaged in the intended marriage,
and consequently that she was indifferent whether it ever
took place or not.</p>

<p>Since the death of the late Earl, she had not been in town;
nor had the present Earl been near the place where she resided,
since the week in which her lover died; of course, nothing
similar to love could have been declared at so early a period;
and if it had been made known at a later, it must only have
been by letter, or by the deputation of Mr. Sandford, who
they knew had been once in the country to visit her; but
how little he was qualified to enforce a tender passion, was
a comfortable reflection.</p>

<p>Revived by these conjectures, of which some were true,
and others false; the very next day a gloom overspread their
bright prospects, on Mr. Sandford's saying, as he entered
the breakfast-room,</p>

<p>"Miss Fenton, ladies, desired me to present her compliments."</p>

<p>"Is she in town?" asked Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>"She came yesterday morning," returned Sandford, "and
is at her brother's, in Ormond-street; my Lord and I supped
there last night, and that made us so late home."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood entered soon after, and bowing to his ward,
confirmed what had been said, by telling her, that "Miss
Fenton had charged him with her kindest respects."</p>

<p>"How does poor Miss Fenton look?" Mrs. Horton asked
Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>To which question Sandford replied, "Beautiful&mdash;she
looks beautifully."</p>

<p>"She has got over her uneasiness, I suppose then?" said
Mrs. Horton&mdash;not dreaming that she was asking the questions
before her new lover.</p>

<p>"Uneasy!" replied Sandford, "uneasy at any trial this
world can send? That would be highly unworthy of her."</p>

<p>"But sometimes women do fret at such things:" replied
Mrs. Horton, innocently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Elmwood asked Miss Milner&mdash;"If she meant to ride,
this delightful day?"</p>

<p>While she was hesitating&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are different kinds of women," (said Sandford,
directing his discourse to Mrs. Horton;) "there is as much
difference between some women, as between good and evil
spirits."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood asked Miss Milner again&mdash;If she took an
airing?</p>

<p>She replied, "No."</p>

<p>"And beauty," continued Sandford, "when endowed
upon spirits that are evil, is a mark of their greater, their
more extreme wickedness. Lucifer was the most beautiful
of all the angels in Paradise"&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you know?" said Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"But the beauty of Lucifer," (continued Sandford, in
perfect neglect and contempt of her question,) "was an
aggravation of his guilt; because it shewed a double share
of ingratitude to the Divine Creator of that beauty."</p>

<p>"Now you talk of angels," said Miss Milner, "I wish I had
wings; and I should like to fly through the park this morning."</p>

<p>"You would be taken for an angel in good earnest," said
Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>Sandford was angry at this little compliment, and cried,
"I should think the serpent's skin would be much more
characteristic."</p>

<p>"My Lord," cried she, "does not Mr. Sandford use me
ill?" Vext with other things, she felt herself extremely
hurt at this, and made the appeal almost in tears.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I think he does." And he looked at Sandford
as if he was displeased.</p>

<p>This was a triumph so agreeable to her, that she immediately
pardoned the offence; but the offender did not so
easily pardon her.</p>

<p>"Good morning, ladies," said Lord Elmwood, rising to
go away.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Miss Woodley, "you promised Miss
Milner to accompany her one evening to the opera; this is
opera night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you go, my Lord?" asked Miss Milner, in a voice
so soft, that he seemed as if he wished, but could not
resist it.</p>

<p>"I am to dine at Mr. Fenton's to-day," he replied;
"and if he and his sister will go, and you will allow them
part of your box, I will promise to come."</p>

<p>This was a condition by no means acceptable to her; but
as she felt a desire to see him in company of his intended
bride, (for she fancied she could perceive his secret sentiments,
could she once see them together) she answered not
ungraciously, "Yes, my compliments to Mr. and Miss
Fenton, and I hope they will favour me with their company."</p>

<p>"Then, Madam, if they come, you may expect me&mdash;else
not." He bowed and left the room.</p>

<p>All the day was passed in anxious expectation by Miss
Milner, what would be the event of the evening: for upon
her penetration that evening all her future prospects she
thought depended. If she saw by his looks, by his words,
or assiduities, that he loved Miss Fenton, she flattered herself
she would never think of him again with hope; but if she
observed him treat her with inattention or indifference, she
would cherish, from that moment, the fondest expectations.
Against that short evening her toilet was consulted the whole
day: the alternate hope and fear which fluttered in her
heart, gave a more than usual brilliancy to her eyes, and more
than usual bloom to her complection. But vain was her
beauty; vain all her care to decorate that beauty; vain her
many looks to her box-door in hopes to see it open&mdash;Lord
Elmwood never came.</p>

<p>The music was discord&mdash;every thing she saw was disgusting&mdash;in
a word, she was miserable.</p>

<p>She longed impatiently for the curtain to drop, because
she was uneasy where she was&mdash;yet she asked herself, "Shall
I be less unhappy at home? Yes; at home I shall see Lord
Elmwood, and that will be happiness. But he will behold
me with neglect, and that will be misery! Ungrateful man!
I will no longer think of him." Yet could she have thought
of him, without joining in the same idea Miss Fenton, her
anguish had been supportable; but while she painted them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
as lovers, the tortures of the rack are but a few degrees more
painful than those which she endured.</p>

<p>There are but few persons who ever felt the real passion
of jealousy, because few have felt the real passion of love;
but with those who have experienced them both, jealousy
not only affects the mind, but every fibre of their frame;
and Miss Milner's every limb felt agonizing torment, when
Miss Fenton, courted and beloved by Lord Elmwood, was
present to her imagination.</p>

<p>The moment the opera was finished, she flew hastily down
stairs, as if to fly from the sufferings she experienced. She
did not go into the coffee-room, though repeatedly urged
by Miss Woodley, but waited at the door till her carriage
drew up.</p>

<p>Piqued&mdash;heart-broken&mdash;full of resentment against the
object of her uneasiness, and inattentive to all that passed,
a hand gently touched her own; and the most humble and
insinuating voice said, "Will you permit me to lead you to
your carriage?" She was awakened from her revery, and
found Lord Frederick Lawnly by her side. Her heart, just
then melting with tenderness to another, was perhaps more
accessible than heretofore; or bursting with resentment,
thought this the moment to retaliate. Whatever passion
reigned that instant, it was favourable to the desires of Lord
Frederick, and she looked as if she was glad to see him: he
beheld this with the rapture and the humility of a lover;
and though she did not feel the least particle of love in
return, she felt gratitude in proportion to the insensibility
with which she had been treated by her guardian; and
Lord Frederick's supposition was not very erroneous, if he
mistook this gratitude for a latent spark of affection. The
mistake, however, did not force from him his respect: he
handed her to her carriage, bowed low, and disappeared.
Miss Woodley wished to divert her thoughts from the object
which could only make her wretched, and as they rode
home, by many encomiums upon Lord Frederick, endeavoured
to incite her to a regard for him; Miss Milner was displeased
at the attempt, and exclaimed,</p>

<p>"What! love a rake, a man of professed gallantry?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
impossible. To me, a common rake is as odious as a common
prostitute is to a man of the nicest feelings. Where can be
the joy, the pride, of inspiring a passion which fifty others
can equally inspire?"</p>

<p>"Strange," cried Miss Woodley, "that you, who possess
so many follies incident to your sex, should, in the disposal
of your heart, have sentiments so contrary to women in
general."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Woodley," returned she, "put in competition
the languid addresses of a libertine, with the animated
affection of a sober man, and judge which has the dominion?
Oh! in my calendar of love, a solemn Lord Chief Justice, or
a devout archbishop, ranks before a licentious king."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley smiled at an opinion which she knew half
her sex would ridicule; but by the air of sincerity with
which it was delivered, she was convinced her recent
behaviour to Lord Frederick was but the mere effect of
chance.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood's carriage drove to his door just at the
time her's did; Mr. Sandford was with him, and they were
both come from passing the evening at Mr. Fenton's.</p>

<p>"So, my Lord," said Miss Woodley, as soon as they met
in the apartment, "you did not come to us?"</p>

<p>"No," answered he, "I was sorry; but I hope you did
not expect me."</p>

<p>"Not expect you, my Lord?" cried Miss Milner; "Did
not you say that you would come?"</p>

<p>"If I had, I certainly should have come," returned he,
"but I only said so conditionally."</p>

<p>"That I am a witness to," cried Sandford, "for I was
present at the time, and he said it should depend upon
Miss Fenton."</p>

<p>"And she, with her gloomy disposition," said Miss Milner,
"chose to sit at home."</p>

<p>"Gloomy disposition!" repeated Sandford: "She has
a great share of sprightliness&mdash;and I think I never saw her
in better spirits than she was this evening, my Lord."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood did not speak.</p>

<p>"Bless me, Mr. Sandford," cried Miss Milner, "I meant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
no reflection upon Miss Fenton's disposition; I only meant
to censure her taste for staying at home."</p>

<p>"I think," replied Mr. Sandford, "a much heavier
censure should be passed upon those who prefer rambling
abroad."</p>

<p>"But I hope, ladies, my not coming," said Lord Elmwood,
"was no inconvenience to you; for you had still, I see,
a gentleman with you."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, two gentlemen:" answered the son of Lady
Evans, a lad from school, whom Miss Milner had taken
along with her.</p>

<p>"What two?" asked Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>Neither Miss Milner nor Miss Woodley answered.</p>

<p>"You know, Madam," said young Evans, "that handsome
gentleman who handed you into your carriage, and
you called my Lord."</p>

<p>"Oh! he means Lord Frederick Lawnly:" said Miss
Milner carelessly, but a blush of shame spread over her face.</p>

<p>"And did he hand you into your coach?" asked Lord
Elmwood earnestly.</p>

<p>"By mere accident, my Lord," Miss Woodley replied,
"for the crowd was so great&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think, my Lord," said Sandford, "it was very lucky
that you were <i>not</i> there."</p>

<p>"Had Lord Elmwood been with us, we should not have had
occasion for the assistance of any other," said Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"Lord Elmwood has been with you, Madam," returned
Sandford, "very frequently, and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford," said Lord Elmwood, interrupting him,
"it is near bed-time, your conversation keeps the ladies from
retiring."</p>

<p>"Your Lordship's does not," said Miss Milner, "for you
say nothing."</p>

<p>"Because, Madam, I am afraid to offend."</p>

<p>"But do not you also hope to please? and without risking
the one, it is impossible to arrive at the other."</p>

<p>"I think, at present, the risk would be too hazardous, and
so I wish you a good night." And he went out of the room
somewhat abruptly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord Elmwood," said Miss Milner, "is very grave&mdash;he
does not look like a man who has been passing the evening with
the woman he loves."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is melancholy at parting from her," said Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>"More likely offended," said Sandford, "at the manner
in which that lady has spoken of her."</p>

<p>"Who, I? I protest I said nothing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing! Did not you say that she was gloomy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but what I thought&mdash;I was going to add,
Mr. Sandford."</p>

<p>"When you think unjustly, you should not express your
thoughts."</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, I should never speak."</p>

<p>"And it were better you did not, if what you say is to
give pain. Do you know, Madam, that my Lord is going
to be married to Miss Fenton?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"Do you know that he loves her?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"How! do you suppose he does not?"</p>

<p>"I suppose that he does, yet I don't know it."</p>

<p>"Then if you suppose that he does, how can you have the
imprudence to find fault with her before him?"</p>

<p>"I did not. To call her gloomy, was, I knew, to commend
her both to him and to you, who admire such tempers."</p>

<p>"Whatever her temper is, <i>every one</i> admires it; and so
far from its being what you have described, she has great
vivacity; vivacity which comes from the heart."</p>

<p>"No, if it <i>came</i> from thence, I should admire it too; but,
if she has any, it rests there, and no one is the better
for it."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Miss Woodley, "it is time for us to
retire; you and Mr. Sandford must finish your dispute in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Dispute, Madam!" said Sandford, "I never disputed
with any one beneath a doctor of divinity in my life. I was
only cautioning your friend not to make light of those virtues
which it would do her honour to possess. Miss Fenton is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
a most amiable young woman, and worthy of just such
a husband as my Lord Elmwood will make her."</p>

<p>"I am sure," said Miss Woodley, "Miss Milner thinks so&mdash;she
has a high opinion of Miss Fenton&mdash;she was at present
only jesting."</p>

<p>"But, Madam, a jest is a very pernicious thing, when
delivered with a malignant sneer. I have known a jest
destroy a lady's reputation&mdash;I have known a jest give one
person a distaste for another&mdash;I have known a jest break off
a marriage."</p>

<p>"But I suppose there is no apprehension of that in the
present case?" said Miss Woodley&mdash;wishing he might
answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Not that I can foresee. No, Heaven forbid," he replied,
"for I look upon them to be formed for each other&mdash;their
dispositions, their pursuits, their inclinations the same.
Their passions for each other just the same&mdash;pure&mdash;white as
snow."</p>

<p>"And I dare say, not warmer," replied Miss Milner.</p>

<p>He looked provoked beyond measure.</p>

<p>"My dear," cried Miss Woodley, "how can you talk
thus? I believe in my heart you are only envious, because
my Lord Elmwood has not offered himself to you."</p>

<p>"To her!" said Sandford, affecting an air of the utmost
surprise; "to her! Do you think he received a dispensation
from his vows, to become the husband of a coquette&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;."&mdash;He
was going on.</p>

<p>"Nay, Mr. Sandford," cried Miss Milner, "I believe,
after all, my worst crime, in your eyes, is that of being
a heretic."</p>

<p>"By no means&mdash;it is the only circumstance that can
apologize for your faults; and if you had not that excuse,
there would be none for you."</p>

<p>"Then, at present, there <i>is</i> an excuse&mdash;I thank you,
Mr. Sandford&mdash;this is the kindest thing you ever said to me.
But I am vext to see that you are sorry you have said it."</p>

<p>"Angry at your being a heretic!" he resumed&mdash;"Indeed
I should be much more concerned to see you a disgrace to
our religion."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Milner had not been in a good humour the whole
evening&mdash;she had been provoked several times to the full
extent of her patience: but this harsh sentence hurried her
beyond all bounds, and she arose from her seat in the most
violent agitation, exclaiming, "What have I done to be thus
treated?"</p>

<p>Though Mr. Sandford was not a man easily intimidated,
he was upon this occasion evidently alarmed; and stared
about him with so violent an expression of surprise, that it
partook, in some degree, of fear. Miss Woodley clasped her
friend in her arms, and cried with the tenderest affection and
pity, "My dear Miss Milner, be composed."</p>

<p>Miss Milner sat down, and was so for a minute; but her
dead silence was almost as alarming to Sandford as her rage
had been; and he did not perfectly recover himself till he
saw tears pouring down her face. He then heaved a sigh
of content that all had thus ended; but in his heart resolved
never to forget the ridiculous affright into which he had been
thrown. He stole out of the room without uttering a
syllable&mdash;but as he never retired to rest before he had
repeated a long form of evening prayer, when this evening
he came to that part which supplicates "Grace for the
wicked," he mentioned Miss Milner's name with the most
fervent devotion.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>


<p>Of the many restless nights that Miss Milner passed, this
was not one. It is true, she had a weight of care upon her
heart, even heavier than usual, but the burden had overcome
her strength: wearied out with hopes, with fears, and, at
the end, with disappointment and rage, she sunk at once
into a deep slumber. But the more forgetfulness had then
prevailed, the more powerful was the force of remembrance
when she awoke. At first, so sound her sleep had been, that
she had a difficulty in calling to mind why she was unhappy;
but that she <i>was</i> unhappy she well recollected&mdash;when the
cause came to her memory, she would have slept again&mdash;but
it was impossible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Though her rest had been sound, it had not been refreshing&mdash;she
was far from well, and sent word of her indisposition,
as an apology for not being present at breakfast. Lord
Elmwood looked concerned when the message was delivered&mdash;Mr.
Sandford shook his head.</p>

<p>"Miss Milner's health is not good!" said Mrs. Horton
a few minutes after.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood laid down the newspaper to attend to her.</p>

<p>"To me, there is something very extraordinary about
her!" continued Mrs. Horton, finding she had caught his
Lordship's attention.</p>

<p>"So there is to me!" added Sandford, with a sarcastic
sneer.</p>

<p>"And so there is to me!" said Miss Woodley, with
a serious face and a heartfelt sigh.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood gazed by turns at each, as each delivered
their sentiments&mdash;and when they were all silent, he looked
bewildered, not knowing what judgment to form from any
of these sentences.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast, Mr. Sandford withdrew to his own
apartment: Mrs. Horton, in a little time, went to hers:
Lord Elmwood and Miss Woodley were left alone. He
immediately rose from his seat, and said,</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Woodley, Miss Milner was extremely to
blame, though I did not chuse to tell her so before Mr. Sandford,
in giving Lord Frederick an opportunity of speaking
to her, unless she means that he shall renew his addresses."</p>

<p>"That, I am certain," replied Miss Woodley, "she does
<i>not</i> mean&mdash;and I assure you, my Lord, seriously, it was by
mere accident she saw him yesterday evening, or permitted
his attendance upon her to her carriage."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it," he returned quickly; "for although
I am not of a suspicious nature, yet in regard to her affections
for him, I cannot but still have my doubts."</p>

<p>"You need have none, my Lord," replied Miss Woodley,
with a smile of confidence.</p>

<p>"And yet you must own her behaviour has warranted
them&mdash;has it not been in this particular incoherent and
unaccountable?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"The behaviour of a person in love, no doubt," answered
Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Don't I say so?" replied he warmly; "and is not that
a just reason for my suspicions?"</p>

<p>"But is there only one man in the world on whom those
suspicions can fix?" said Miss Woodley, with the colour
mounting into her face.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of&mdash;not one more that I know of," he
replied, with astonishment at what she had insinuated, and
yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am mistaken," answered she.</p>

<p>"Nay, that is impossible too," returned he with anxiety&mdash;"You
share her confidence&mdash;you are perpetually with her;
and if she did not confide in you, (which I know, and rejoice
that she does) you would yet be acquainted with all her
inclinations."</p>

<p>"I believe I am <i>perfectly</i> acquainted with them," replied
Miss Woodley, with a significance in her voice and manner
which convinced him there was some secret to learn.</p>

<p>After a hesitation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is far from me," replied he, "to wish to be entrusted
with the private sentiments of those who desire to with-hold
them from me; much less would I take any unfair
means to be informed of them. To ask any more questions
of you, I believe, would be unfair. Yet I cannot but lament
that I am not as well informed as you are. I wish to prove
my friendship to Miss Milner, but she will not suffer me&mdash;and
every step that I take for her happiness, I take in the
most perplexing uncertainty."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley sighed&mdash;but she did not speak. He seemed
to wait for her reply; but as she made none, he proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"If ever breach of confidence could be tolerated, I certainly
know no occasion that would so justly authorise it as
the present. I am not only proper from character, but
from circumstances, to be relied upon&mdash;my interest is so
nearly connected with the interest, and my happiness with
the happiness of my ward, that those principles, as well as
my honour, would protect her against every peril arising
from my being trusted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! my Lord," cried Miss Woodley, with a most
forcible accent, "<i>You</i> are the last person on earth she would
pardon me for entrusting."</p>

<p>"Why so?" said he, warmly. "But that is the way&mdash;the
person who is our friend we distrust&mdash;where a common
interest is concerned, we are ashamed of drawing on a common
danger&mdash;afraid of advice, though that advice is to save us.&mdash;&mdash;Miss
Woodley," said he, changing his voice with excess of
earnestness, "do you not believe, that I would do anything
to make Miss Milner happy?"</p>

<p>"Any thing in honour, my Lord."</p>

<p>"She can desire nothing farther," he replied in agitation.
"Are her desires so unwarrantable, that I cannot grant
them?"</p>

<p>Miss Woodley again did not speak&mdash;and he continued&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great as my friendship is, there are certainly bounds to
it&mdash;bounds that shall save her in spite of herself:"&mdash;and he
raised his voice.</p>

<p>"In the disposal of themselves," resumed he, with a less
vehement tone, "that great, that terrific disposal in marriage,
(at which I have always looked with fear and dismay) there
is no accounting for the rashness of a woman's choice, or
sometimes for the depravity of her taste. But in such a case,
Miss Milner's election of a husband shall not direct mine.
If she does not know how to estimate her own value, I do.
Independent of her fortune, she has beauty to captivate the
heart of any man; and with all her follies, she has a frankness
in her manner, an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts,
a vivacity in her conversation, and withal, a softness in her
demeanour, that might alone engage the affections of a man
of the nicest sentiments, and the strongest understanding.
I will not see all these qualities and accomplishments debased.
It is my office to protect her from the consequences of a
degrading choice, and I will."</p>

<p>"My Lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one; it
is but too refined."</p>

<p>"What can you mean by that, Miss Woodley? You talk
mysteriously. Is she not afraid that I will thwart her
inclinations?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is sure that you will, my Lord."</p>

<p>"Then must the person be unworthy of her."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley rose from her seat&mdash;she clasped her hands&mdash;every
look and every gesture proved her alternate resolution
and irresolution of proceeding. Lord Elmwood's attention
was arrested before; but now it was fixed to a degree which
her extraordinary manner only could occasion.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said she, with a tremulous voice, "promise
me, declare to me, nay, swear to me, that it shall ever remain
a secret in your own breast, and I will reveal to you, on whom
she has placed her affections."</p>

<p>This preparation made Lord Elmwood tremble, and he
ran over instantly in his mind all the persons he could recollect,
in order to arrive at the knowledge by thought, quicker
than by words. It was in vain he tried; and he once more
turned his inquiring eyes upon Miss Woodley. He saw her
silent and covered with confusion. Again he searched his
own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before. At the first
glance, the object was presented, and he beheld&mdash;<i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>The rapid emotion of varying passions, which immediately
darted over his features, informed Miss Woodley that her
secret was discovered&mdash;she hid her face, while the tears that
fell down to her bosom, confirmed the truth of his suggestion,
beyond what oaths could have done. A short interval of
silence followed, during which, she suffered tortures for the
manner in which he would next address her&mdash;two seconds
gave her this reply:</p>

<p>"For God's sake take care what you are doing&mdash;you are
destroying my prospects of futurity&mdash;you are making this
world too dear to me."</p>

<p>Her drooping head was then lifted up, and she caught the
eye of Dorriforth; she saw it beam expectation, amazement,
joy, ardour, and love.&mdash;&mdash;Nay, there was a fire, a vehemence
in the quick fascinating rays it sent forth, she never before
had seen&mdash;it filled her with alarm&mdash;she wished him to love
Miss Milner, but to love her with moderation. Miss Woodley
was too little versed in the subject, to know, this would
have been not to love at all; at least, not to the extent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
breaking through engagements, and all the various obstacles
that still militated against their union.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood was sensible of the embarrassment his
presence gave Miss Woodley, and understood the reproaches
which she seemed to vent upon herself in silence. To relieve
her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart,
and said, "Do you believe me?"</p>

<p>"I do, my Lord," she answered, trembling.</p>

<p>"I will make no unjust use of what I know," he replied
with firmness.</p>

<p>"I believe you, my Lord."</p>

<p>"But for what my passions now dictate," continued he,
"I will not answer. They are confused&mdash;they are triumphant
at present. I have never yet, however, been vanquished
by them; and even upon this occasion, my reason
shall combat them to the last&mdash;and my reason shall fail me,
before I do wrong."</p>

<p>He was going to leave the room&mdash;she followed him, and
cried, "But, my Lord, how shall I see again the unhappy
object of my treachery?"</p>

<p>"See her," replied he, "as one to whom you meant no
injury, and to whom you have done none."</p>

<p>"But she would account it an injury."</p>

<p>"We are not judges of what belongs to ourselves," he
replied&mdash;"I am transported at the tidings you have revealed,
and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was going to say something farther, but as
if incapable of attending to her, he hastened out of the room.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>


<p>Miss Woodley stood for some time to consider which
way she was to go. The first person she met, would enquire
why she had been weeping? and if Miss Milner was to ask
the question, in what words could she tell, or in what manner
deny the truth? To avoid her was her first caution, and she
took the only method; she had a hackney-coach ordered,
rode several miles out of town, and returned to dinner with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
so little remains of her swoln eyes, that complaining of the
head-ache was a sufficient excuse for them.</p>

<p>Miss Milner was enough recovered to be present at dinner,
though she scarce tasted a morsel. Lord Elmwood did not
dine at home, at which Miss Woodley rejoiced, but at which
Mr. Sandford appeared highly disappointed. He asked the
servants several times, what he said when he went out? They
replied, "Nothing more than that he should not be at home
to dinner."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine where he dines?" said
Sandford.</p>

<p>"Bless me, Mr. Sandford, can't you guess?"
(cried Mrs. Horton, who by this time was made acquainted
with his intended marriage) "He dines with Miss Fenton
to be sure."</p>

<p>"No," replied Sandford, "he is not there;
I came from thence just now, and they had not seen him
all day." Poor Miss Milner, on this, ate something; for
where we hope for nothing, we receive small indulgencies
with joy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the anxiety and trouble under which
Miss Woodley had laboured all the morning, her heart for
many weeks had not felt so light as it did this day at dinner.
The confidence that she reposed in the promises of Lord
Elmwood&mdash;the firm reliance she had upon his delicacy and
his justice&mdash;the unabated kindness with which her friend
received her, while she knew that no one suspicious thought
had taken harbour in her bosom&mdash;and the conscious integrity
of her own intentions, though she might have been misled
by her judgment, all comforted her with the hope, she had
done nothing she ought to wish recalled. But although she
felt thus tranquil, in respect to what she had divulged, yet
she was a good deal embarrassed with the dread of next
seeing Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>Miss Milner, not having spirits to go abroad, passed the
evening at home. She read part of a new opera, played upon
her guitar, mused, sighed, occasionally talked with Miss
Woodley, and so passed the tedious hours till near ten, when
Mrs. Horton asked Mr. Sandford to play a game at piquet,
and on his excusing himself, Miss Milner offered in his stead,
and was gladly accepted. They had just begun to play
when Lord Elmwood came into the room&mdash;Miss Milner's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
countenance immediately brightened, and though she was
in a negligent morning dress, and looked paler than usual, she
did not look less beautiful. Miss Woodley was leaning on
the back of her chair to observe the game, and Mr. Sandford
sat reading one of the Fathers at the other side of the fire
place. Lord Elmwood, as he advanced to the table, bowed,
not having seen the ladies since the morning, or Miss Milner
that day: they returned the salute, and he was going up
to Miss Milner, (as if to enquire of her health) when Mr. Sandford,
laying down his book, said,</p>

<p>"My Lord, where have you been all day?"</p>

<p>"I have been very busy," replied he, and walking from
the card-table, went up to him.</p>

<p>Miss Milner played one card for another.</p>

<p>"You have been at Mr. Fenton's this evening, I suppose?"
said Sandford.</p>

<p>"No; not at all to-day."</p>

<p>"How came that about, my Lord?"</p>

<p>Miss Milner played the ace of diamonds instead of the
king of hearts.</p>

<p>"I shall call to-morrow," answered Lord Elmwood; and
then walking with a very ceremonious air up to Miss Milner,
said, "He hoped she was perfectly recovered."</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton begged her "To mind what she was about."
She replied, "I am much better, Sir."</p>

<p>He then returned to Sandford again; but never, during
all this time, did his eye once encounter Miss Woodley's; and
she, with equal care, avoided his.</p>

<p>Some cold dishes were now brought up for supper&mdash;Miss
Milner lost her deal, and the game ended.</p>

<p>As they were arranging themselves at the supper-table,
"Do, Miss Milner," said Mrs. Horton, "have something
warm for your supper; a chicken boiled, or something of
that kind; you have eat nothing to-day."</p>

<p>With feelings of humanity, and apparently no other sensation&mdash;but
never did he feel his philanthropy so forcible&mdash;Lord
Elmwood said, "Let me beg of you, Miss Milner, to
have something provided for you."</p>

<p>The earnestness and emphasis with which these few words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
were pronounced, were more flattering than the finest turned
compliment would have been; her gratitude was expressed
in blushes, and by assuring him she was now "So well, as to
sup on the dishes before her." She spoke, however, and had
not made the trial; for the moment she carried a morsel
to her lips, she laid it on her plate again, and turned paler,
from the vain endeavour to force her appetite. Lord Elmwood
had always been attentive to her; but now he watched
her as he would a child; and when he saw by her struggles
that she could not eat, he took her plate from her; gave her
something else; and all with a care and watchfulness in his
looks, as if he had been a tender-hearted boy, and she his
darling bird, the loss of which would embitter all the joy
of his holidays.</p>

<p>This attention had something in it so tender, so officious,
and yet so sincere, that it brought the tears into Miss Woodley's
eyes, attracted the notice of Mr. Sandford, and the
observation of Mrs. Horton; while the heart of Miss Milner
overflowed with a gratitude, that gave place to no sentiment
except her love.</p>

<p>To relieve the anxiety which her guardian expressed, she
endeavoured to appear cheerful, and that anxiety, at length,
really made her so. He now pressed her to take one glass of
wine with such solicitude, that he seemed to say a thousand
things besides. Sandford still made his observations, and
being unused to conceal his thoughts before the present
company, he said bluntly,</p>

<p>"Miss Fenton was indisposed the other night, my Lord,
and you did not seem half thus anxious about her."</p>

<p>Had Sandford laid all Lord Elmwood's estate at Miss
Milner's feet, or presented her with that eternal bloom which
adorns the face of a goddess, he would have done less to
endear himself to her, than by this one sentence&mdash;she looked
at him with a most benign countenance, and felt affliction
that she had ever offended him.</p>

<p>"Miss Fenton," Lord Elmwood replied, "has a brother
with her: her health and happiness are in <i>his</i> care&mdash;Miss
Milner's are in mine."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford," said Miss Milner, "I am afraid that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
I behaved uncivilly to you last night&mdash;will you accept of an
atonement?"</p>

<p>"No, Madam," returned he, "I accept no expiation
without amendment."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said she, smiling, "suppose I promise
never to offend you again, what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, you'll break your promise."</p>

<p>"Do not promise him," said Lord Elmwood, "for he
means to provoke you to it."</p>

<p>In the like conversation the evening passed, and Miss Milner
retired to rest in far better spirits than her morning's prospect
had given her the least pretence to hope. Miss Woodley,
too, had cause to be well pleased; but her pleasure was in
great measure eclipsed by the reflection, that there was such
a person as Miss Fenton&mdash;she wished she had been equally
acquainted with her's as with Miss Milner's heart, and she
would then have acted without injustice to either; but Miss
Fenton had of late shunned their society, and even in their
company was of a temper too reserved ever to discover her
mind; Miss Woodley was obliged, therefore, to act to the
best of her own judgment only, and leave all events to
Providence.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>


<p>Within a few days, in the house of Lord Elmwood, every
thing, and every person, wore a new face. He, was the
professed lover of Miss Milner&mdash;she, the happiest of human
beings&mdash;Miss Woodley partaking in the joy&mdash;Mr. Sandford
lamenting, with the deepest concern, that Miss Fenton had
been supplanted; and what added poignantly to his concern
was, that she had been supplanted by Miss Milner. Though
a churchman, he bore his disappointment with the impatience
of one of the laity: he could hardly speak to
Lord Elmwood; he would not look at Miss Milner, and was
displeased with every one. It was his intention, when he
first became acquainted with Lord Elmwood's resolution, to
quit his house; and as the Earl had, with the utmost degree
of inflexibility, resisted all his good counsel upon this subject,
he resolved, in quitting him, never to be his adviser again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
But, in preparing to leave his friend, his pupil, his patron,
and yet him, who, upon most occasions, implicitly obeyed
his will, the spiritual got the better of the temporal man,
and he determined to stay, lest in totally abandoning him to
the pursuit of his own passions, he should make his punishment
even greater than his offence. "My Lord," said he,
"on the stormy sea, upon which you are embarked, though
you will not shun the rocks that your faithful pilot would
point out, he will, nevertheless, sail in your company, and
lament over your watery grave. The more you slight my
advice, the more you want it; so that, until you command
me to leave your house, (as I suppose you will soon do, to
oblige your Lady) I will continue along with you."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood liked him sincerely, and was glad that he
took this resolution; yet as soon as his reason and affections
had once told him that he ought to break with Miss Fenton,
and marry his ward, he became so decidedly of this opinion,
that Sandford's never had the most trivial weight; nor would
he even flatter the supposed authority he possessed over him,
by urging him to remain in his house a single day, contrary
to his inclinations. Sandford observed, with grief, this
firmness; but finding it vain to contend, submitted&mdash;not,
however, with a good grace.</p>

<p>Amidst all the persons affected by this change in Lord
Elmwood's marriage-designs, Miss Fenton was, perhaps,
affected the least&mdash;she would have been content to have
married, she was content to live single. Mr. Sandford had
been the first who made overtures to her on the part of
Lord Elmwood, and was the first sent to ask her to dispense
with the obligation.&mdash;She received both of these proposals
with the same insipid smile of approbation, and the same
cold indifference at the heart.</p>

<p>It was a perfect knowledge of this disposition in his intended
wife which had given to Lord Elmwood's thoughts on
matrimony, the idea of dreary winter; but the sensibility
of Miss Milner had now reversed that prospect into perpetual
spring; or the dearer variety of spring, summer, and autumn.</p>

<p>It was a knowledge also of this torpor in Miss Fenton's
nature, from which he formed the purpose of breaking with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
her; for Lord Elmwood still retained enough of the sanctity
of his former state to have yielded up his own happiness,
and even that of his beloved ward, rather than have plunged
one heart into affliction by his perfidy. This, before he
offered his hand to Miss Milner, he was perfectly convinced
would not be the case&mdash;even Miss Fenton herself assured
him, that her thoughts were more upon the joys of Heaven
than upon those of earth; and as this circumstance would,
she believed, induce her to retire into a convent, she thought
it a happy, rather than an unhappy, event. Her brother, on
whom her fortune devolved if she took this resolution, was
exactly of her opinion.</p>

<p>Lost in the maze of happiness that surrounded her, Miss
Milner oftentimes asked her heart, and her heart whispered
like a flatterer, "Yes;" Are not my charms even more
invincible than I ever believed them to be? Dorriforth, the
grave, the pious, the anchorite Dorriforth, by their force, is
animated to all the ardour of the most impassioned lover&mdash;while
the proud priest, the austere guardian is humbled, if
I but frown, into the veriest slave of love. She then asked,
"Why did I not keep him longer in suspense? He could
not have loved me more, I believe: but my power over him
might have been greater still. I am the happiest of women
in the affection he has proved to me, but I wonder whether
it would exist under ill treatment? If it would not, he still
does not love me as I wish to be loved&mdash;if it would, my
triumph, my felicity, would be enhanced." These thoughts
were mere phantoms of the brain, and never, by system,
put into action; but, repeatedly indulged, they were practised
by casual occurrences; and the dear-bought experiment
of being loved in spite of her faults, (a glory proud
women ever aspire to) was, at present, the ambition of
Miss Milner.</p>

<p>Unthinking woman! she did not reflect, that to the
searching eye of Lord Elmwood, she had faults, with her
utmost care to conceal or overcome them, sufficient to try
all his love, and all his patience. But what female is not
fond of experiments? To which, how few do not fall a
sacrifice!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Perfectly secure in the affections of the man she loved,
her declining health no longer threatened her; her declining
spirits returned as before; and the suspicions of her guardian
being now changed to the liberal confidence of a doting
lover, she again professed all her former follies, all her fashionable
levities, and indulged them with less restraint than ever.</p>

<p>For a while, blinded by his passion, Lord Elmwood
encouraged and admired every new proof of her restored
happiness; nor till sufferance had tempted her beyond her
usual bounds, did he remonstrate. But she, who, as his ward,
had been ever gentle, and (when he strenuously opposed)
always obedient; became, as a mistress, sometimes haughty,
and, to opposition, always insolent. He was surprised, but
the novelty pleased him. And Miss Milner, whom he
tenderly loved, could put on no change, or appear in no
new character that did not, for the time she adopted it,
seem to become her.</p>

<p>Among the many causes of complaint which she gave him,
want of &#339;conomy, in the disposal of her income, was one.
Bills and drafts came upon him without number, while the
account, on her part, of money expended, amounted chiefly
to articles of dress that she sometimes never wore, toys that
were out of fashion before they were paid for, and charities
directed by the force of whim. Another complaint was, as
usual, extreme late hours, and often company that he did
not approve.</p>

<p>She was charmed to see his love struggling with his censure&mdash;his
politeness with his anxiety&mdash;and by the light, frivolous,
or resentful manner in which she treated his admonitions,
she triumphed in shewing to Miss Woodley, and, more
especially to Mr. Sandford, how much she dared upon the
strength of his affections.</p>

<p>Everything in preparation for their marriage, which was
to take place at Elmwood House during the summer months,
she resolved for the short time she had to remain in London
to let no occasion pass of tasting all those pleasures that were
not likely ever to return; but which, though eager as she
was in their pursuit, she never placed in competition with
those she hoped would succeed&mdash;those more sedate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
superior joys, of domestic and conjugal happiness. Often,
merely to hasten on the tedious hours that intervened, she
varied and diverted them, with the many recreations her
intended husband could not approve.</p>

<p>It so happened, and it was unfortunate it did, that a lawsuit
concerning some possessions in the West Indies, and
other intricate affairs that came with his title and estate,
frequently kept Lord Elmwood from his house part of the
day; sometimes the whole evening; and when at home,
would often closet him for hours with his lawyers. But
while he was thus off his guard, Sandford never was&mdash;and
had Miss Milner been the dearest thing on earth to him, he
could not have watched her more narrowly; or had she been
the frailest thing on earth, he could not have been more
hard upon her, in all the accounts of her conduct he gave
to her guardian. Lord Elmwood knew, on the other hand,
that Sandford's failing was to think ill of Miss Milner&mdash;he
pitied him for it, and he pitied her for it&mdash;and in all the
aggravation which his representations gave to her real
follies, affection for them both, in the heart of Dorriforth,
stood between that and every other impression.</p>

<p>But facts are glaring; and he, at length, beheld those
faults in their true colours, though previously pointed out
by the prejudice of Mr. Sandford.</p>

<p>As soon as Sandford perceived his friend's uneasiness,
"There, my Lord!" cried he, exultingly, "did I not
always say the marriage was an improper one? but you would
not be ruled&mdash;you would not see."</p>

<p>"Can you blame <i>me</i> for not seeing," replied his Lordship,
"when <i>you</i> were blind? Had you been dispassionate, had
you seen Miss Milner's virtues as well as her faults, I should
have believed, and been guided by you&mdash;but you saw her
failings only, and therein have been equally deceived with
me, who have only beheld her perfections."</p>

<p>"My observations, however, my Lord, would have been
of most use to you; for I have seen what to avoid."</p>

<p>"But mine have been the most gratifying," replied he;
"for I have seen&mdash;what I must always love."</p>

<p>Sandford sighed, and lifted up his hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford," resumed Lord Elmwood, with a voice
and manner such as he used to put on when not all the power
of Sandford, or of any other, could change his fixed determination,
"Mr. Sandford, my eyes are now open to every
failing, as well as to every accomplishment; to every vice,
as well as to every virtue of Miss Milner; nor will I suffer
myself to be again prepossessed in her favour, by your prejudice
against her&mdash;for I believe it was compassion at your
unkind treatment, that first gained her my heart."</p>

<p>"I, my Lord?" cried Sandford; "do not load me with
the burthen&mdash;with the mighty burthen of your love for her."</p>

<p>"Do not interrupt me. Whatever your meaning has been,
the effect of it is what I have described. Now, I will no
longer," continued he, "have an enemy, such as you have
been, to heighten her charms, which are too transcendent
in their native state. I will hear no more complaints against
her, but I will watch her closely myself&mdash;and if I find her
mind and heart (such as my suspicions have of late whispered)
too frivolous for that substantial happiness I look for with an
object so beloved, depend upon my word&mdash;the marriage
shall yet be broken off."</p>

<p>"I depend upon your word; it <i>will</i> then,"&mdash;replied Sandford
eagerly.</p>

<p>"You are unjust, Sir, in saying so before the trial," replied
Lord Elmwood, "and your injustice shall make me more
cautious, lest I follow your example."</p>

<p>"But, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My mind is made up, Mr. Sandford," returned he,
interrupting him; "I am no longer engaged to Miss Milner
than she shall deserve I should be&mdash;but, in my strict observations
upon her conduct, I will take care not to wrong her
as you have done."</p>

<p>"My Lord, call my observations wrong, when you have
reflected upon them as a man, and not as a lover&mdash;divest
yourself of your passion, and meet me upon equal ground."</p>

<p>"I will meet no one&mdash;I will consult no one&mdash;my own
judgment shall be the judge, and in a few months marry, or&mdash;<i>banish
me from her for ever</i>."</p>

<p>There was something in these last words, in the tone and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
firmness with which they were delivered, that the heart of
Sandford rested upon with content&mdash;they bore the symptoms
of a menace that would be executed; and he parted from
his patron with congratulations upon his wisdom, and with
giving him the warmest assurances of his firm reliance on
his <i>word</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood having come to this resolution, was more
composed than he had been for several days before; while
the horror of domestic wrangles&mdash;a family without subordination&mdash;a
house without &#339;conomy&mdash;in a word, a wife without
discretion, had been perpetually present to his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandford, although he was a man of understanding, of
learning, and a complete casuist, yet all the faults he himself
committed, were entirely&mdash;for want of knowing better.
He constantly reproved faults in others, and he was most
assuredly too good a man not to have corrected and amended
his own, had they been known to him&mdash;but they were not.
He had been for so long a time the superior of all with whom
he lived, had been so busied with instructing others, that he
had not recollected that himself wanted instructions&mdash;and
in such awe did his habitual severity keep all about him,
that although he had numerous friends, not one told him
of his failings&mdash;except just now Lord Elmwood, but whom,
in this instance, as a man in love, he would not credit. Was
there not then some reason for him to suppose he <i>had</i> no
faults? his enemies, indeed, hinted that he had, but enemies
he never harkened to; and thus, with all his good sense,
wanted the sense to follow the rule, <i>Believe what your enemies
say of you, rather than what is said by your friends</i>. This
rule attended to, would make a thousand people amiable,
who are now the reverse; and would have made <i>him</i> a perfectly
upright character. For could an enemy to whom
he would have listened, have whispered to Sandford as he
left Lord Elmwood, "Cruel, barbarous man! you go away
with your heart satisfied, nay, even elated, in the prospect
that Miss Milner's hopes, on which she alone exists, those
hopes which keep her from the deepest affliction, and cherish
her with joy and gladness, will all be disappointed. You
flatter yourself it is for the sake of your friend, Lord Elm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>wood,
that you rejoice, and because he has escaped a danger.
You wish him well; but there is another cause for your
exultation which you will not seek to know&mdash;it is, that in
his safety, shall dwell the punishment of his ward. For
shame! for shame! forgive her faults, as this of yours
requires to be forgiven."</p>

<p>Had any one said this to Sandford, whom he would have
credited, or had his own heart suggested it, he was a man of
that rectitude and conscientiousness, that he would have
returned immediately to Lord Elmwood, and have strengthened
all his favourable opinions of his intended wife&mdash;but
having no such monitor, he walked on, highly contented,
and meeting Miss Woodley, said, with an air of triumph,</p>

<p>"Where's your friend? where's Lady Elmwood?"</p>

<p>Miss Woodley smiled, and answered&mdash;She was gone with
such and such ladies to an auction. "But why give her that
title already, Mr. Sandford?"</p>

<p>"Because," answered he, "I think she will never have it."</p>

<p>"Bless me, Mr. Sandford," said Miss Woodley, "you
shock me!"</p>

<p>"I thought I should," replied he, "and therefore I told
it you."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing new&mdash;her indiscretions only."</p>

<p>"I know she is imprudent," said Miss Woodley&mdash;"I can
see that her conduct is often exceptionable&mdash;but then Lord
Elmwood surely loves her, and love will overlook a great
deal."</p>

<p>"He <i>does</i> love her&mdash;but he has understanding and resolution.
He loved his sister too, tenderly loved her, and yet
when he had taken the resolution, and passed his word that
he would never see her again&mdash;even upon her death-bed he
would not retract it&mdash;no entreaties could prevail upon him.
And now, though he maintains, and I dare say loves, her
child, yet you remember, when you brought him home, that
he would not suffer him in his sight."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Milner!" said Miss Woodley, in the most
pitying accents.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Sandford, "Lord Elmwood has not <i>yet</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
passed his word, that he will never see her more&mdash;he has
only threatened to do it; but I know enough of him to
know, that his threats are generally the same as if they were
executed."</p>

<p>"You are very good," said Miss Woodley, "to acquaint
me of this in time&mdash;I may now warn Miss Milner of it, and
she may observe more circumspection."</p>

<p>"By no means," cried Sandford, hastily&mdash;"What would
you warn her for? It will do her no good&mdash;besides," added
he, "I don't know whether Lord Elmwood does not expect
secrecy on my part; and if he does&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, with all deference to your opinion," said Miss
Woodley, (and with all deference did she speak) "don't you
think, Mr. Sandford, that secrecy upon this occasion would
be wicked? For consider the anguish that it may occasion
to my friend; and if, by advising her, we can save her
from&mdash;&mdash;" She was going on.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may call it wicked, Madam, not to inform her of
what I have hinted at," cried he; "but I call it a breach
of confidence&mdash;if it <i>was</i> divulged to me in confidence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was going to explain; but Miss Milner entered, and
put an end to the discourse. She had been passing the
whole morning at an auction, and had laid out near two
hundred pounds in different things for which she had
no one use, but bought them because they were said to be
cheap&mdash;among the rest was a lot of books upon chemistry,
and some Latin authors.</p>

<p>"Why, Madam," cried Sandford, looking over the catalogue
where her purchases were marked by a pencil, "do you
know what you have done? You can't read a word of these
books."</p>

<p>"Can't I, Mr. Sandford? But I assure you that you will
be very much pleased with them, when you see how elegantly
they are bound."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Horton, "why have you bought
china? You and my Lord Elmwood have more now, than
you have places to put them in."</p>

<p>"Very true, Mrs. Horton&mdash;I forgot that&mdash;but then you
know I can give these away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Elmwood was in the room at the conclusion of this
conversation&mdash;&mdash;he shook his head and sighed.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said she, "I have had a very agreeable
morning; but I wished for you&mdash;if you had been with me,
I should have bought a great many other things; but I did
not like to appear unreasonable in your absence."</p>

<p>Sandford fixed his inquisitive eyes upon Lord Elmwood,
to observe his countenance&mdash;he smiled, but appeared
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"And, oh! my Lord, I have bought you a present,"
said she.</p>

<p>"I do not wish for a present, Miss Milner."</p>

<p>"What not from me? Very well."</p>

<p>"If you present me with yourself, it is all that I ask."</p>

<p>Sandford moved upon his chair, as if he sat uneasy.</p>

<p>"Why then, Miss Woodley," said Miss Milner, "<i>you</i> shall
have the present. But then it won't suit you&mdash;it is for
a gentleman. I'll keep it and give it to my Lord Frederick
the first time I meet with him. I saw him this morning,
and he looked divinely&mdash;I longed to speak to him."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley cast, by stealth, an eye of apprehension
upon Lord Elmwood's face, and trembled at seeing it
flushed with resentment.</p>

<p>Sandford stared with both his eyes full upon him: then
threw himself upright on his chair, and took a pinch of snuff
upon the strength of the Earl's uneasiness.</p>

<p>A silence ensued.</p>

<p>After a short time&mdash;"You all appear melancholy," said
Miss Milner: "I wish I had not come home yet."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was in agony&mdash;she saw Lord Elmwood's
extreme displeasure, and dreaded lest he should express it by
some words he could not recall, or she could not forgive&mdash;therefore,
whispering to her she had something particular
to say, she took her out of the room.</p>

<p>The moment she was gone, Mr. Sandford rose nimbly from
his seat, rubbed his hands, walked briskly across the room,
then asked Lord Elmwood in a cheerful tone, "Whether he
dined at home to-day?"</p>

<p>That which had given Sandford cheerfulness, had so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
depressed Lord Elmwood, that he sat dejected and silent.
At length he answered in a faint voice, "No, I believe I shall
<i>not</i> dine at home."</p>

<p>"Where is your Lordship going to dine?" asked Mrs.
Horton; "I thought we should have had your company
to-day; Miss Milner dines at home, I believe."</p>

<p>"I have not yet determined where I shall dine," replied he,
taking no notice of the conclusion of her speech.</p>

<p>"My Lord, if you mean to go to the hotel, I'll go with
you, if you please," cried Sandford officiously.</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Sandford&mdash;" and they both went
out together, before Miss Milner returned to the apartment.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<a name="II_CHAPTER_VIII" id="II_CHAPTER_VIII"></a><h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>


<p>Miss Woodley, for the first time, disobeyed the will of
Mr. Sandford; and as soon as Miss Milner and she were
alone, repeated all he had revealed to her; accompanying
the recital, with her usual testimonies of sympathy and
affection. But had the genius of Sandford presided over
this discovery, it could not have influenced the mind of
Miss Milner to receive the intelligence with a temper more
exactly the opposite of that which it was the intention of the
informer to recommend. Instead of shuddering at the
menace Lord Elmwood had uttered, she said, she "Dared
him to perform it." "He dares not," repeated she.</p>

<p>"Why dares not?" said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Because he loves me too well&mdash;because his own happiness
is too dear to him."</p>

<p>"I believe he loves you," replied Miss Woodley, "and yet
there is a doubt if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There shall be no longer a doubt," cried Miss Milner,
"I'll put him to the proof."</p>

<p>"For shame, my dear! you talk inconsiderately&mdash;what
can you mean by proof?"</p>

<p>"I mean I will do something that no prudent man <i>ought</i>
to forgive; and yet, with all his vast share of prudence, <i>he</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
shall forgive it, and make a sacrifice of just resentment to
partial affection."</p>

<p>"But if you should be disappointed, and he should <i>not</i>
make the sacrifice?" said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Then I have only lost a man who had no regard for
me."</p>

<p>"He may have a great regard for you, notwithstanding."</p>

<p>"But for the love I have felt, and do still feel, for my
Lord Elmwood, I will have something more than a <i>great
regard</i> in return."</p>

<p>"You have his love, I am sure."</p>

<p>"But is it such as mine? <i>I</i> could love <i>him</i> if he had
a thousand faults. And yet," said she, recollecting herself,
"and yet, I believe his being faultless, was the first cause
of my passion."</p>

<p>Thus she talked on&mdash;sometimes in anger, sometimes
apparently jesting&mdash;till her servant came to let her know
the dinner was served. Upon entering the dining-room,
and seeing Lord Elmwood's place at table vacant, she started
back. She was disappointed of the pleasure she expected
in dining with him; and his sudden absence, so immediately
after the intelligence that she had received from Miss Woodley,
increased her uneasiness. She drew her chair, and sat down
with an indifference, that said she should not eat; and as
soon as she was seated, she put her fingers sullenly to her
lips, nor touched her knife and fork, nor spoke a word in
reply to any thing that was said to her during the whole
dinner. Miss Woodley and Mrs. Horton were both too well
acquainted with the good disposition of her heart, to take
offence, or appear to notice this behaviour. They dined,
and said nothing either to provoke or sooth her. Just as
the dinner was going to be removed, a loud rap came at the
door&mdash;"Who is that?" said Mrs. Horton. One of the
servants went to the window, and answered, "My Lord and
Mr. Sandford, Madam."</p>

<p>"Come back to dinner as I live," cried Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>Miss Milner continued her position and said nothing&mdash;but
at the corners of her mouth, which her fingers did not
entirely cover, there were discoverable, a thousand dimpled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
graces like small convulsive fibres, which a restrained smile
upon Lord Elmwood's return, had sent there.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood and Sandford entered.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are returned, my Lord," said Mrs. Horton,
"for Miss Milner would not eat a morsel."</p>

<p>"It was only because I had no appetite," returned she,
blushing like crimson.</p>

<p>"We should not have come back," said Sandford, "but
at the place where we went to dine, all the rooms were filled
with company."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood put the wing of a fowl on Miss Milner's
plate, but without previously asking if she chose any; yet she
condescended to eat&mdash;they spoke to each other too in the
course of conversation, but it was with a reserve that appeared
as if they had been quarrelling, and felt so to themselves,
though no such circumstance had happened.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed away in this kind of distant behaviour
on both sides, without either of them venturing a direct
quarrel, and without either of them expressing (except
inadvertently) their strong affection for each other.</p>

<p>During this time they were once, however, very near
becoming the dearest friends in expression, as well as in
sentiment. This arose from a favour that he had granted
in compliance with her desire, though that desire had not
been urged, but merely insinuated; and as it was a favour
which he had refused to the repeated requests of many of
his friends, the value of the obligation was heightened.</p>

<p>She and Miss Woodley had taken an airing to see the poor
child, young Rushbrook. Lord Elmwood inquiring of the
ladies how they had passed their morning, Miss Milner
frankly told him; and added, "What pain it gave her to
leave the child behind, as he had again cried to come away
with her."</p>

<p>"Go for him then to-morrow," said Lord Elmwood, "and
bring him home."</p>

<p>"Home!" she repeated, with surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he, "if you desire it, this shall be his home&mdash;you
shall be a mother, and I will, henceforward, be a father
to him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Sandford, who was present, looked unusually sour at this
high token of regard for Miss Milner; yet, with resentment
on his face, he wiped a tear of joy from his eye, for the boy's
sake&mdash;his frown was the force of prejudice, his tear the force
of nature.</p>

<p>Rushbrook was brought home; and whenever Lord
Elmwood wished to shew a kindness to Miss Milner, without
directing it immediately to her, he took his nephew upon
his knee, talked to him, and told him, he "Was glad they
had become acquainted."</p>

<p>In the various, though delicate, struggles for power between
Miss Milner and her guardian, there was not one person a
witness to these incidents, who did not suppose, that all would
at last end in wedlock&mdash;for the most common observer perceived,
that ardent love was the foundation of every discontent,
as well as of every joy they experienced. One great
incident, however, totally reversed the hope of all future
accommodation.</p>

<p>The fashionable Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash; gave a masked ball; tickets
were presented to persons of quality and fashion; among
the rest, three were sent to Miss Milner. She had never
been at a masquerade, and received them with ecstasy&mdash;the
more especially, as the masque being at the house of a woman
of fashion, she did not conceive there could be any objection
to her going. She was mistaken&mdash;the moment she mentioned
it to Lord Elmwood, he desired her, somewhat sternly,
"Not to think of being there." She was vexed at the prohibition,
but more at the manner in which it was delivered, and
boldly said, "That she should certainly go."</p>

<p>She expected a rebuke for this, but what alarmed her
much more, he said not a word; but looked with a resignation,
which foreboded her sorrow greater than the severest
reproaches would have done. She sat for a minute, reflecting
how to rouse him from this composure&mdash;she first
thought of attacking him with upbraidings; then she
thought of soothing him; and at last of laughing at him.
This was the most dangerous of all, and yet, this she ventured
upon.</p>

<p>"I am sure your Lordship," said she, "with all your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
saintliness, can have no objection to my being present at
the masquerade, if I go as a Nun."</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>"That is a habit," continued she, "which covers a multitude
of faults&mdash;and, for that evening, I may have the chance
of making a conquest even of you&mdash;nay, I question not, if
under that inviting attire, even the pious Mr. Sandford
would not ogle me."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Why hush?" cried Miss Milner, aloud, though Miss
Woodley had spoken in a whisper, "I am sure," continued
she, "I am only repeating what I have read in books about
nuns and their confessors."</p>

<p>"Your conduct, Miss Milner," replied Lord Elmwood
"gives evident proofs of the authors you have read; you
may spare yourself the trouble of quoting them."</p>

<p>Her pride was hurt at this, beyond bearing; and as she
could not, like him, govern her anger, it flushed in her face,
and almost forced her into tears.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Miss Woodley, (in a tone so soft and
peaceful, that it should have calmed the resentment of both,)
"my Lord, suppose you were to accompany Miss Milner?
there are tickets for three, and you can then have no objection."</p>

<p>Miss Milner's brow was immediately smoothed; and she
fetched a sigh, in anxious expectation that he would consent.</p>

<p>"I go, Miss Woodley?" he replied, with astonishment,
"Do you imagine I would play the buffoon at a masquerade?"</p>

<p>Miss Milner's face changed into its former state.</p>

<p>"I have seen grave characters there, my Lord," said Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Woodley," cried Miss Milner, "why persuade
Lord Elmwood to put on a mask, just at the time he has laid
it aside?"</p>

<p>His patience was now tempted to its height, and he
answered, "If you suspect me of inconsistency, Madam, you
shall find me changed."</p>

<p>Pleased that she had been able at last to irritate him, she
smiled with a degree of triumph, and in that humour was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
going to reply; but before she could speak four words, and
before she thought of it, he abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>She was highly offended at this insult, and declared,
"From that moment she banished him from her heart for
ever." And to prove that she set his love and his anger at
equal defiance, she immediately ordered her carriage, and
said, she "Was going to some of her acquaintance, whom
she knew to have tickets, and with whom she would fix upon
the habit she was to appear in at the masquerade; for
nothing, unless she was locked up, should alter the resolution
she had formed, of being there." To remonstrate at that
moment, Miss Woodley knew would be in vain&mdash;her coach
came to the door, and she drove away.</p>

<p>She did not return to dinner, nor till it was late in the
evening; Lord Elmwood was at home, but he never once
mentioned her name.</p>

<p>She came home, after he had retired, in great spirits; and
then, for the first time, in her whole life, appeared careless
what he might think of her behaviour:&mdash;but her whole
thoughts were occupied upon the business which had
employed the chief of her day; and her dress engrossed all her
conversation, as soon as Miss Woodley and she were alone.
She told her, she had been shewn the greatest variety of
beautiful and becoming dresses she had ever beheld; "and
yet," said she, "I have at last fixed upon a very plain one;
but one I look so well in, that you will hardly know me, when
I have it on."</p>

<p>"You are seriously then resolved to go," said Miss Woodley,
"if you hear no more on the subject from your guardian?"</p>

<p>"Whether I do hear or not, Miss Woodley, I am equally
resolved to go."</p>

<p>"But you know, my dear, he has desired you not&mdash;and
you used always to obey his commands."</p>

<p>"As my guardian, I certainly did obey him; and I could
obey him as a husband; but as a lover, I will not."</p>

<p>"Yet that is the way never to have him for a husband."</p>

<p>"As he pleases&mdash;for if he will not submit to be my lover,
I will not submit to be his wife&mdash;nor has he the affection
that I require in a husband."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the old sentiments, repeated again and again, prevented
a separation till towards morning.</p>

<p>Miss Milner, for that night, dreamed less of her guardian
than of the masquerade. On the evening of the next day
it was to be&mdash;she was up early, breakfasted in her dressing
room, and remained there most of the day, busied in a
thousand preparations for the night; one of them was, to
take every particle of powder out of her hair, and have it
curled all over in falling ringlets. Her next care was, that
her dress should exactly fit, and display her fine person to
the best advantage&mdash;it did so. Miss Woodley entered as it
was trying on, and was all astonishment at the elegance of
the habit, and its beautiful effect upon her graceful person;
but, most of all, she was astonished at her venturing on such
a character&mdash;for though it represented the goddess of
Chastity, yet from the buskins, and the petticoat festooned
far above the ankle, it had, on a first glance, the appearance
of a female much less virtuous. Miss Woodley admired this
dress, yet objected to it; but as she admired first, her
objections after had no weight.</p>

<p>"Where is Lord Elmwood?" said Miss Milner&mdash;"he
must not see me."</p>

<p>"No, for heaven's sake," cried Miss Woodley, "I would
not have him see you in such a disguise for the universe."</p>

<p>"And yet," returned the other, with a sigh, "why am
I then thus pleased with my dress? for I had rather he
should admire me than all the world besides, and yet he is
not to see me in it."</p>

<p>"But he would not admire you so dressed," said Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>"How shall I contrive to avoid him," said Miss Milner,
"if in the evening he should offer to hand me into my
carriage? But I believe he will not be in good humour
enough for that."</p>

<p>"You had better dress at the house of the ladies with
whom you go," said Miss Woodley; and this was agreed
upon.</p>

<p>At dinner they learnt that Lord Elmwood was to go that
evening to Windsor, in order to be in readiness for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
king's hunt early in the morning. This intelligence having
dispersed Miss Milner's fears, she concluded upon dressing
at home.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood appeared at dinner, in an even, but not in
a good temper; the subject of the masquerade was never
brought up, nor indeed was it once in his thoughts; for
though he was offended at his ward's behaviour on the
occasion, and considered that she committed a fault in
telling him, "She would go," yet he never suspected she
meant to do so, not even at the time she said it, much less
that she would persist, coolly and deliberately, in so direct
a contradiction to his will. She, for her part, flattered
herself, that his going to Windsor, was intended in order
to give her an opportunity of passing the evening as she
pleased, without his being obliged to know of it, and consequently
to complain. Miss Woodley, who was willing to
hope as she wished, began to be of the same opinion; and,
without reluctance, dressed herself as a wood-nymph to
accompany her friend.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<a name="II_CHAPTER_IX" id="II_CHAPTER_IX"></a><h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>


<p>At half after eleven, Miss Milner's chair, and another with
Miss Woodley, took them from Lord Elmwood's, to call
upon the party (wood-nymphs and huntresses) who were to
accompany them, and make up the suit of Diana.</p>

<p>They had not left the house two minutes, when a thundering
rap came at the door&mdash;it was Lord Elmwood in a post
chaise. Upon some occasion the next day's hunt was deferred:
he had been made acquainted with it, and came
from Windsor at that late hour. After he had informed
Mrs. Horton and Mr. Sandford, who were sitting together,
of the cause of his sudden return, and had supper ordered
for him, he enquired, "What company had just left the
house?"</p>

<p>"We have been alone the whole evening, my Lord,"
replied Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>"Nay," returned he, "I saw two chairs, with several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
servants, come out of the door as I drove up, but what livery
I could not discern."</p>

<p>"We have had no creature here," repeated Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>"Nor has Miss Milner had visitors?" asked he.</p>

<p>This brought Mrs. Horton to her recollection, and she
cried, "Oh! now I know;"&mdash;&mdash;and then checked herself,
as if she knew too much.</p>

<p>"What do you know, Madam?" said he, sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Mrs. Horton, "I know nothing&mdash;" and
she lifted up her hands and shook her head.</p>

<p>"So all people say, who know a great deal," cried Sandford,
"and I suspect that is at present your case."</p>

<p>"Then I know more than I wish, I am sure, Mr. Sandford,"
returned she, shrugging up her shoulders.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood was all impatience.</p>

<p>"Explain, Madam, explain."</p>

<p>"Dear my Lord," said she, "if your Lordship will recollect,
you may just have the same knowledge that I have."</p>

<p>"Recollect what?" said he sternly.</p>

<p>"The quarrel you and your ward had about the masquerade."</p>

<p>"What of that? she is not gone there?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I am not sure she is," returned Mrs. Horton; "but if
your Lordship saw two sedan chairs going out of this house,
I cannot but suspect it must be Miss Milner and my niece
going to the masquerade."</p>

<p>He made no answer, but rang the bell violently. A servant
entered. "Send Miss Milner's maid hither," said he,
"immediately." The man withdrew.</p>

<p>"Nay, my Lord," cried Mrs. Horton, "any of the other
servants could tell you just as well, whether Miss Milner is
at home, or gone out."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," replied he.</p>

<p>The maid entered.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" said Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>The woman had received no orders to conceal where the
ladies were gone, and yet a secret influence which governs the
thoughts of all waiting-women and chambermaids, whispered
to her that she ought not to tell the truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" repeated he, in a louder voice
than before.</p>

<p>"Gone out, my Lord," she replied.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"My Lady did not tell me."</p>

<p>"And don't you know?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord:" she answered, and without blushing.</p>

<p>"Is this the night of the masquerade?" said he.</p>

<p>"I don't know, my Lord, upon my word; but, I believe,
my Lord, it is not."</p>

<p>Sandford, as soon as Lord Elmwood had asked the last
question, ran hastily to the table, at the other side of the
room, took something from it, and returned to his place
again&mdash;and when the maid said, "It was not the night of
the masquerade," he exclaimed, "But it is, my Lord, it is&mdash;yes,
it is," and shewing a newspaper in his hand, pointed to
the paragraph which contained the information.</p>

<p>"Leave the room," said Lord Elmwood to the woman,
"I have done with you." She withdrew.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, here it is," repeated Sandford, with the paper
in his hand.&mdash;&mdash;He then read the paragraph: "'<i>The masquerade
at the honorable Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;'s this evening</i>'&mdash;This
evening, my Lord, you find&mdash;'<i>it is expected will be the
most brilliant, of any thing of the kind for these many years
past.</i>'"</p>

<p>"They should not put such things in the papers," said
Mrs. Horton, "to tempt young women to their ruin." The
word ruin grated upon Lord Elmwood's ear, and he said to
the servant who came to wait on him, while he supped,
"Take the supper away." He had not attempted either to
eat, or even to sit down; and he now walked backwards and
forwards in the room, lost in thought and care.</p>

<p>A little time after, one of Miss Milner's footmen came in
upon some occasion, and Mr. Sandford said to him, "Pray
did you attend your lady to the masquerade?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood stopped himself short in his walk, and said
to the servant, "You did?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord," replied he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked again.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what she was dressed in," said
Mrs. Horton: and turning to the servant, "Do you know
what your lady had on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam," replied the man, "she was in men's
clothes."</p>

<p>"How!" cried Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"You tell a story, to be sure," said Mrs. Horton to the
servant.</p>

<p>"No," cried Sandford, "I am sure he does not; for he is
an honest good young man, and would not tell a lie upon
any account&mdash;would you, George?"</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood ordered Miss Milner's woman to be again
sent up. She came.</p>

<p>"In what dress did your lady go to the masquerade?"
asked he, and with a look so extremely morose, it seemed
to command the answer in a single word, and that word to
be truth.</p>

<p>A mind, with a spark of sensibility more than this woman
possessed, could not have equivocated with such an interrogator,
but her reply was, "She went in her own dress, my
Lord."</p>

<p>"Was it a man's or a woman's?" asked he, with a look of
the same command.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, my Lord," (half laughing and half crying)
"a woman's dress, to be sure, my Lord."</p>

<p>On which Sandford cried&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Call the footman up, and let him confront her."</p>

<p>He was called; but Lord Elmwood, now disgusted at the
scene, withdrew to the further end of the room, and left
Sandford to question them.</p>

<p>With all the authority and consequence of a country
magistrate, Sandford&mdash;his back to the fire, and the witnesses
before him, began with the footman.</p>

<p>"In what dress do you say, that you saw your lady,
when you attended, and went along with her, to the masquerade?"</p>

<p>"In men's clothes," replied the man, boldly and firmly
as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bless my soul, George, how can you say such a thing?"
cried the woman.</p>

<p>"What dress do <i>you</i> say she went in?" cried Sandford
to her.</p>

<p>"In women's clothes, indeed, Sir."</p>

<p>"This is very odd!" said Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>"Had she on, or had she not on, a coat?" asked Sandford.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, a petticoat," replied the woman.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> say she had on a petticoat?" said Sandford to the
man.</p>

<p>"I can't answer exactly for that," replied he, "but I know
she had boots on."</p>

<p>"They were not boots," replied the maid with vehemence&mdash;"indeed,
Sir, (turning to Sandford) they were only half
boots."</p>

<p>"My girl," said Sandford kindly to her, "your own
evidence convicts your mistress&mdash;What has a woman to do
with <i>any</i> boots?"</p>

<p>Impatient at this mummery, Lord Elmwood rose, ordered
the servants out of the room, and then, looking at his watch,
found it was near one. "At what hour am I to expect her
home?" said he.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not till three in the morning," answered
Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>"Three! more likely six," cried Sandford.</p>

<p>"I can't wait with patience till that time," answered Lord
Elmwood, with a most anxious sigh.</p>

<p>"You had better go to bed, my Lord," said Mrs. Horton;
"and, by sleeping, the time will pass away unperceived."</p>

<p>"If I <i>could</i> sleep, Madam."</p>

<p>"Will you play a game of cards, my Lord?" said Sandford,
"for I will not leave you till she comes home; and
though I am not used to sit up all night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All night!" repeated Lord Elmwood; "she dares not
stay all night."</p>

<p>"And yet, after going," said Sandford, "in defiance to
your commands, I should suppose she dared."</p>

<p>"She is in good company, at least, my Lord," said
Mrs. Horton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"She does not know herself what company she is in,"
replied he.</p>

<p>"How should she," cried Sandford, "where every one
hides his face?"</p>

<p>Till five o'clock in the morning, in conversation such as
this, the hours passed away. Mrs. Horton, indeed, retired
to her chamber at two, and left the gentlemen to a more
serious discourse; but a discourse still less advantageous to
poor Miss Milner.</p>

<p>She, during this time, was at the scene of pleasure she had
painted to herself, and all the pleasure it gave her was, that
she was sure she should never desire to go to a masquerade
again. Its crowd and bustle fatigued her&mdash;its freedom
offended her delicacy&mdash;and though she perceived that she
was the first object of admiration in the place, yet there was
one person still wanting to admire; and the remorse at
having transgressed his injunctions for so trivial an entertainment,
weighed upon her spirits, and added to its weariness.
She would have come away sooner than she did,
but she could not, with any degree of good manners, leave
the company with whom she went; and not till half after
four, were they prevailed on to return.</p>

<p>Daylight just peeped through the shutters of the room
in which Lord Elmwood and Sandford were sitting, when
the sound of her carriage, and the sudden stop it made at
the door, caused Lord Elmwood to start from his chair. He
trembled extremely, and looked pale. Sandford was ashamed
to seem to notice it, yet he could not help asking him, "To
take a glass of wine." He took it&mdash;and for once, evinced he
was reduced so low, as to be <i>glad</i> of such a resource.</p>

<p>What passion thus agitated Lord Elmwood at this crisis, it
is hard to define&mdash;perhaps it was indignation at Miss Milner's
imprudence, and exultation at being on the point of revenge&mdash;perhaps
it was emotion arising from joy, to find that she
was safe&mdash;perhaps it was perturbation at the regret he felt
that he must upbraid her&mdash;perhaps it was not one alone of
these sensations, but all of them combined.</p>

<p>She, wearied out with the tedious night's dissipation, and
far less joyous than melancholy, had fallen asleep as she rode<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
home, and came half asleep out of her carriage. "Light me
to my bed-chamber instantly," said she to her maid, who
waited in the hall to receive her. But one of Lord Elmwood's
valets went up to her, and answered, "Madam, my Lord
desires to see you before you retire."</p>

<p>"Your Lord!" she cried, "Is he not out of town?"</p>

<p>"No, Madam, my Lord has been at home ever since you
went out; and has been sitting up with Mr. Sandford,
waiting for you."</p>

<p>She was wide awake immediately. The heaviness was
removed from her eyes, but fear, grief, and shame, seized
upon her heart. She leaned against her maid, as if unable to
support herself under those feelings, and said to Miss
Woodley,</p>

<p>"Make my excuse&mdash;I cannot see him to-night&mdash;I am unfit&mdash;indeed
I cannot."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was alarmed at the idea of going to him by
herself, and thus, perhaps, irritating him still more: she,
therefore, said, "He has sent for <i>you</i>; for heaven's sake, do
not disobey him a second time."</p>

<p>"No, dear Madam, don't," cried her woman, "for he is
like a lion&mdash;he has been scolding me."</p>

<p>"Good God!" (exclaimed Miss Milner, and in a tone
that seemed prophetic) "Then he is not to be my husband,
after all."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Miss Woodley, "if you will only be humble,
and appear sorry. You know your power over him, and all
may yet be well."</p>

<p>She turned her speaking eyes upon her friend, the tears
starting from them, her lips trembling&mdash;"Do I not appear
sorry?" she cried.</p>

<p>The bell at that moment rang furiously, and they hastened
their steps to the door of the apartment where Lord Elmwood
was.</p>

<p>"No, this shuddering is only fright," replied Miss Woodley&mdash;"Say
to him you are sorry, and beg his pardon."</p>

<p>"I cannot," said she, "if Mr. Sandford is with him."</p>

<p>The servant opened the door, and she and Miss Woodley
went in. Lord Elmwood, by this time, was composed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
received her with a slight inclination of his head&mdash;she bowed
to him in return, and said, with some marks of humility,</p>

<p>"I suppose, my Lord, I have done wrong."</p>

<p>"You have indeed, Miss Milner," answered he; "but
do not suppose, that I mean to upbraid you: I am, on the
contrary, going to release you from any such apprehension
<i>for the future</i>."</p>

<p>Those last three words he delivered with a countenance
so serious and so determined, with an accent so firm and so
decided, they pierced through her heart. Yet she did not
weep, or even sigh; but her friend, knowing what she felt,
exclaimed, "Oh?" as if for her.</p>

<p>She herself strove with her anguish, and replied, (but with
a faltering voice) "I expected as much, my Lord."</p>

<p>"Then, Madam, you perhaps expect <i>all</i> that I intend?"</p>

<p>"In regard to myself," she replied, "I suppose I do."</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "you may expect that in a few days we
shall part."</p>

<p>"I am prepared for it, my Lord," she answered, and, while
she said so, sunk upon a chair.</p>

<p>"My Lord, what you have to say farther," said Miss
Woodley, in tears, "defer till the morning&mdash;Miss Milner,
you see, is not able to bear it now."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to <i>say</i> further," replied he coolly&mdash;"I
have now only to act."</p>

<p>"Lord Elmwood," cried Miss Milner, divided between
grief and anger, "you think to terrify me by your menaces&mdash;but
I can part with you&mdash;heaven knows I can&mdash;your late
behaviour has reconciled me to a separation."</p>

<p>On this he was going out of the room&mdash;but Miss Woodley,
catching hold of him, cried, "Oh! my Lord, do not leave
her in this sorrow&mdash;pity her weakness, and forgive it." She
was proceeding; and he seemed as if inclined to listen, when
Sandford called out in a tone of voice so harsh,</p>

<p>"Miss Woodley, what do you mean?"&mdash;She gave a start,
and desisted.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood then turned to Sandford, and said, "Nay,
Mr. Sandford, you need entertain no doubts of me&mdash;I have
judged, and have deter&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>He was going to say <i>determined</i>; but Miss Milner, who
dreaded the word, interrupted the period, and exclaimed,
"Oh! could my poor father know the days of sorrow I have
experienced since his death, how would he repent his fatal
choice of a protector!"</p>

<p>This sentence, in which his friend's memory was recalled,
with an additional allusion to her long and secret love for
him, affected Lord Elmwood much&mdash;he was moved, but
ashamed of being so, and as soon as possible conquered the
propensity to forgive. Yet, for a short interval, he did not
know whether to go out of the room, or to remain in it;
whether to speak, or to be silent. At length he turned
towards her, and said,</p>

<p>"Appeal to your father in some other form&mdash;in that
(pointing at her dress) he will not know you. Reflect upon
him, too, in your moments of dissipation, and let his idea
controul your indiscretions&mdash;not merely in an hour of contradiction
call peevishly upon his name, only to wound the
dearest friend you have."</p>

<p>There was a degree of truth, and a degree of passionate
feeling, in the conclusion of this speech, that alarmed Sandford&mdash;he
caught up one of the candles, and, laying hold of
his friend's elbow, drew him out of the room, crying, "Come,
my Lord, come to your bed-chamber&mdash;it is very late&mdash;it is
morning&mdash;it is time to rise." And by a continual repetition
of these words, in a very loud voice, drowned whatever Lord
Elmwood, or any other person might have wished either to
have said or to have heard.</p>

<p>In this manner, Lord Elmwood was forced out of the
apartment, and the evening's entertainment concluded.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<a name="II_CHAPTER_X" id="II_CHAPTER_X"></a><h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Two whole days passed in the bitterest suspense on the
part of Miss Milner, while neither one word or look from
Lord Elmwood, denoted the most trivial change of the
sentiments he had declared, on the night of the masquerade.
Still those sentiments, or intentions, were not explicitly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
delivered; they were more like intimations, than solemn
declarations&mdash;for though he had said, "He would never
reproach her <i>for the future</i>," and that "She might expect
they should part," he had not positively said they should;
and upon this doubtful meaning of his words, she hung with
the strongest agitation of hope and of fear.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley seeing the distress of her mind, (much as she
endeavoured to conceal it) entreated, nay implored of her,
to permit her to be a mediator; to suffer her to ask for
a private interview with Lord Elmwood, and if she found
him inflexible, to behave with a proper spirit in return;
but if he appeared not absolutely averse to a reconciliation,
to offer it in so cautious a manner, that it might take place
without farther uneasiness on either side. But Miss Milner
peremptorily forbade this, and acknowledging to her friend
every weakness she felt on the occasion, yet concluded with
solemnly declaring, "That after what had passed between
her and Lord Elmwood, <i>he</i> must be the first to make a concession,
before she herself would condescend to be reconciled."</p>

<p>"I believe I know Lord Elmwood's temper," replied
Miss Woodley, "and I do not think he will be easily induced
to beg pardon for a fault which he thinks <i>you</i> have
committed."</p>

<p>"Then he does not love me."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Miss Milner, this is the old argument. He may
love you too well to spoil you&mdash;consider that he is your
guardian as well as your lover, he means also to become your
husband; and he is a man of such nice honour, that he will
not indulge you with any power before marriage, to which
he does not intend to submit hereafter."</p>

<p>"But tenderness, affection, the politeness due from a lover
to his mistress demands his submission; and as I now despair
of enticing, I will oblige him to it&mdash;at least I'll make the
trial, and know my fate at once."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?"</p>

<p>"Invite Lord Frederick to the house, and ask my guardian's
consent for our immediate union; you will then see, what
effect that will have upon his pride."</p>

<p>"But you will then make it too late for him to be humble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
If you resolve on this, my dear Miss Milner, you are undone
at once&mdash;you may thus hurry yourself into a marriage with
a man you do not love, and the misery of your whole future
life may be the result. Or, would you force Mr. Dorriforth
(I mean Lord Elmwood) to another duel with my Lord
Frederick?"</p>

<p>"No, call him Dorriforth," answered she, with the tears
stealing from her eyes; "I thank you for calling him so;
for by that name alone, is he dear to me."</p>

<p>"Nay, Miss Milner, with what rapture did you not receive
his love, as Lord Elmwood!"</p>

<p>"But under this title he has been barbarous; under the
first, he was all friendship and tenderness."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Miss Milner indulged herself in all these
soft bewailings to her friend&mdash;before Lord Elmwood she
maintained a degree of pride and steadiness, which surprised
even him, who perhaps thought less of her love for him, than
any other person. She now began to fear she had gone too
far in discovering her affection, and resolved to make trial
of a contrary method. She determined to retrieve that
haughty character which had inspired so many of her
admirers with passion, and take the chance of its effect upon
this only one, to whom she ever acknowledged a mutual
attachment. But although she acted this character well&mdash;so
well, that every one but Miss Woodley thought her in
earnest&mdash;yet, with nice and attentive anxiety, she watched
even the slightest circumstances that might revive her hopes,
or confirm her despair. Lord Elmwood's behaviour was
calculated only to produce the latter&mdash;he was cold, polite,
and perfectly indifferent. Yet, whatever his manners now
were, they did not remove from her recollection what they
had been&mdash;she recalled, with delight, the ardour with which
he had first declared his passion to her, and the thousand
proofs he had since given of its reality. From the constancy
of his disposition, she depended that sentiments like these
were not totally eradicated; and from the extreme desire
which Mr. Sandford now, more than ever, discovered of
depreciating her in his patron's esteem&mdash;from the now, more
than common zeal, which urged him to take Lord Elmwood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
from her company, whenever he had it in his power, she was
led to believe, that while his friend entertained such strong
fears of his relapsing into love, she had reason to indulge the
strongest hopes that he would.</p>

<p>But the reserve, and even indifference, that she had so well
assumed for a few days, and which might perhaps have
effected her design, she had not the patience to persevere in,
without calling levity to their aid. She visited repeatedly
without saying where, or with whom&mdash;kept later hours than
usual&mdash;appeared in the highest spirits&mdash;sung, laughed, and
never heaved a sigh&mdash;but when she was alone.</p>

<p>Still Lord Elmwood protracted a resolution, that he was
determined he would never break when taken.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was excessively uneasy, and with cause;
she saw her friend was providing herself with a weight of
cares, that she would soon find infinitely too much for her
strength to bear&mdash;she would have reasoned with her, but
all her arguments had long since proved unavailing. She
wished to speak to Lord Elmwood upon the subject, and
(unknown to her) plead her excuse; but he apprehended
Miss Woodley's intention, and evidently shunned her.
Mr. Sandford was now the only person to whom she could
speak of Miss Milner, and the delight he took to expatiate on
her faults, was more sorrow to her friend, than not to speak
of her at all. She, therefore, sat a silent spectator, waiting
with dread for the time when she, who now scorned her
advice, would fly to her in vain for comfort.</p>

<p>Sandford had, however, said one thing to Miss Woodley,
which gave her a ray of hope. During their conversation on
the subject, (not by way of consolation to her, but as a reproach
to Lord Elmwood) he one day angrily exclaimed,
"And yet, notwithstanding all this provocation, he has not
come to the determination that he will think no more of her&mdash;he
lingers and he hesitates&mdash;I never saw him so weak upon
any occasion before."</p>

<p>This was joyful hearing to Miss Woodley; still, she could
not but reflect, the longer he was in coming to this determination,
the more irrevocable it would be, when once taken;
and every moment that passed, she trembled lest it should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
be the very moment, in which Lord Elmwood should resolve
to banish Miss Milner from his heart.</p>

<p>Amongst her unpardonable indiscretions, during this trial
upon the temper of her guardian, was the frequent mention
of many gentlemen, who had been her professed admirers,
and the mention of them with partiality. Teased, if not
tortured, by this, Lord Elmwood still behaved with a manly
evenness of temper, and neither appeared provoked on the
subject, nor insolently careless. In a single instance, however,
this calmness was near deserting him.</p>

<p>Entering the drawing-room, one evening, he started, on
seeing Lord Frederick Lawnly there, in earnest conversation
with Miss Milner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton and Miss Woodley were both indeed present,
and Lord Frederick was talking in an audible voice, upon
some indifferent subjects; but with that impressive manner,
in which a man never fails to speak to the woman he loves,
be the subject what it may. The moment Lord Elmwood
started, which was the moment he entered, Lord Frederick
arose.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my Lord," said Lord Elmwood,
"I protest I did not know you."</p>

<p>"I ought to entreat your Lordship's pardon," returned
Lord Frederick, "for this intrusion, which an accident alone
has occasioned. Miss Milner has been almost overturned
by the carelessness of a lady's coachman, in whose carriage
she was, and therefore suffered me to bring her home in
mine."</p>

<p>"I hope you are not hurt," said Lord Elmwood to Miss
Milner, but his voice was so much affected by what he felt
that he could scarce articulate the words. Not with the
apprehension that she was hurt, was he thus agitated, for
the gaiety of her manners convinced him <i>that</i> could not be
the case, nor did he indeed suppose any accident, of the kind
mentioned, had occurred; but the circumstance of unexpectedly
seeing Lord Frederick had taken him off his guard,
and being totally unprepared, he could not conceal indications
of the surprise, and of the shock it had given him.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick, who had heard nothing of his intended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
union with his ward, (for it was even kept a secret, at present,
from every servant in the house) imputed this discomposure
to the personal resentment he might bear him, in consequence
of their duel; for though Lord Elmwood had assured the
uncle of Lord Frederick, (who once waited upon him on the
subject of Miss Milner) that all resentment was, on his part,
entirely at an end; and that he was willing to consent to his
ward's marriage with his nephew, if she would concur; yet
Lord Frederick doubted the sincerity of this, and would still
have had the delicacy not to have entered Lord Elmwood's
house, had he not been encouraged by Miss Milner, and
emboldened by his love. Personal resentment was therefore
the construction he put upon Lord Elmwood's emotion on
entering the room; but Miss Milner and Miss Woodley
knew his agitation to arise from a far different cause.</p>

<p>After his entrance, Lord Frederick did not attempt once
to resume his seat, but having bowed most respectfully to all
present, he took his leave; while Miss Milner followed him
as far as the door, and repeated her thanks for his protection.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood was hurt beyond measure; but he had
a second concern, which was, that he had not the power
to conceal how much he was affected. He trembled&mdash;when
he attempted to speak, he stammered&mdash;he perceived his face
burning with confusion, and thus one confusion gave birth
to another, till his state was pitiable.</p>

<p>Miss Milner, with all her assumed gaiety and real insolence,
had not, however, the insolence to seem as if she observed
him; she had only the confidence to observe him by stealth.
And Mrs. Horton and Miss Woodley, having opportunely
begun a discourse upon some trivial occurrences, gave him
time to recover himself by degrees&mdash;yet, still it was merely
by degrees; for the impression which this incident had
made, was deep, and not easily to be erased. The entrance
of Mr. Sandford, who knew nothing of what had happened,
was however, another relief; for he began a conversation
with him, which they very soon retired into the library to
terminate. Miss Milner, taking Miss Woodley with her,
went directly to her own apartment, and there exclaimed
in rapture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is mine&mdash;he loves me&mdash;and he is mine for ever."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley congratulated her upon believing so, but
confessed she herself "Had her fears."</p>

<p>"What fears?" cried Miss Milner: "don't you perceive
that he loves me?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Miss Woodley, "but that I always believed;
and, I think, if he loves you now, he has yet the good sense to
know that he has reason to hate you."</p>

<p>"What has good sense to do with love?" returned Miss
Milner&mdash;"If a lover of mine suffers his understanding to
get the better of his affection&mdash;"</p>

<p>The same arguments were going to be repeated; but Miss
Woodley interrupted her, by requiring an explanation of
her conduct as to Lord Frederick, whom, at least, she was
treating with cruelty, if she only made use of his affection
to stimulate that of Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"By no means, my dear Miss Woodley," returned she&mdash;"I
have, indeed, done with my Lord Frederick from this
day; and he has certainly given me the proof I wanted of
Lord Elmwood's love; but then I did not engage him to this
by the smallest ray of hope. No; do not suspect me of
that, while my heart was another's: and I assure you,
seriously, that it was from the circumstance we described he
came with me home&mdash;yet, I must own, that if I had not had
this design upon Lord Elmwood's jealousy in idea, I would
have walked on foot through the streets, rather than have
suffered his rival's civilities. But he pressed his services so
violently, and my Lady Evans (in whose coach I was when
the accident happened) pressed me so violently to accept them,
that he cannot expect any farther meaning from this acquiescence
than my own convenience."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was going to reply, when she resumed,</p>

<p>"Nay, if you intend to say I have done wrong, still I am
not sorry for it, when it has given me such convincing proofs
of Lord Elmwood's love. Did you see him? I am afraid
you did not see how he trembled? and that manly voice
faltered, as mine does sometimes&mdash;his proud heart was
humbled too, as mine is now and then. Oh! Miss Woodley,
I have been counterfeiting indifference to <i>him</i>&mdash;I now find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
that all <i>his</i> indifference to <i>me</i> has been counterfeit, and that
we not only love, but love equally."</p>

<p>"Suppose this all as you hope&mdash;I yet think it highly
necessary that your guardian should be informed, seriously
informed, it was mere accident (for, at present, that plea
seems but as a subterfuge) which brought Lord Frederick
hither."</p>

<p>"No, that will be destroying the work so successfully
begun. I will not suffer any explanation to take place, but
let my Lord Elmwood act just as his love shall dictate; and
now I have no longer a doubt of its excess, instead of stooping
to him, I wait in the certain expectation of his submission
to me."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>In vain, for three long days, did Miss Milner wait impatiently
for this submission; not a sign, not a symptom
appeared&mdash;nay, Lord Elmwood had, since the evening of
Lord Frederick's visit, (which, at the time it happened,
seemed to affect him so exceedingly) become just the same
man he was before the circumstance occurred; except,
indeed, that he was less thoughtful, and now and then
cheerful; but without any appearance that his cheerfulness
was affected. Miss Milner was vext&mdash;she was alarmed&mdash;but
was ashamed to confess those humiliating sensations, even to
Miss Woodley&mdash;she supported, therefore, when in company,
the vivacity she had so long assumed; but gave way, when
alone, to a still greater degree of melancholy than usual.
She no longer applauded her scheme of bringing Lord
Frederick to the house, and trembled, lest, on some pretence,
he should dare to call again. But as these were feelings which
her pride would not suffer her to disclose even to her friend,
who would have condoled with her, their effects were doubly
poignant.</p>

<p>Sitting in her dressing-room one forenoon with Miss
Woodley, and burthened with a load of grief that she blushed
to acknowledge, while her companion was charged with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
apprehensions that she too was loath to disclose, one of
Lord Elmwood's valets tapped gently at the door, and
delivered a letter to Miss Milner. By the person who
brought it, as well as by the address, she knew it came from
Lord Elmwood, and laid it down upon her toilet, as if she
was fearful to unfold it.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"A letter from Lord Elmwood," replied Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"Good Heaven!" exclaimed Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Nay," returned she, "it is, I have no doubt, a letter
to beg my pardon." But her reluctance to open it plainly
evinced she did not think so.</p>

<p>"Do not read it yet," said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"I do not intend it," replied she, trembling extremely.</p>

<p>"Will you dine first?" said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;for not knowing its contents, I shall not know how
to conduct myself towards him."</p>

<p>Here a silence followed. Miss Milner took up the letter&mdash;looked
earnestly at the handwriting on the outside&mdash;at the
seal&mdash;inspected into its folds&mdash;and seemed to wish, by some
equivocal method, to guess at the contents, without having
the courage to come at the certain knowledge of them.</p>

<p>Curiosity, at length, got the better of her fears&mdash;she
opened the letter, and, scarce able to hold it while she read,
she read the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>"While I considered you only as my ward, my friendship
for you was unbounded&mdash;when I looked upon you as
a woman formed to grace a fashionable circle, my admiration
equalled my friendship&mdash;and when fate permitted me to
behold you in the tender light of my betrothed wife, my
soaring love left those humbler passions at a distance.</p>

<p>"That you have still my friendship, my admiration, and
even my love, I will not attempt to deceive either myself or
you by disavowing; but still, with a firm assurance, I declare,
that prudence outweighs them all; and I have not, from
henceforward, a wish to be regarded by you, in any other
respect than as one 'who wishes you well.' That you ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>beheld me in the endearing quality of a destined and
an affectionate husband, (such as I would have proved) was
a deception upon my hopes: they acknowledge the mistake,
and are humbled&mdash;but I entreat you to spare their farther
trial, and for a single week do not insult me with the open
preference of another. In the short space of that period
I shall have taken my leave of you&mdash;<i>for ever</i>.</p>

<p>"I shall visit Italy, and some other parts of the Continent;
from whence I propose passing to the West Indies, in order
to inspect my possessions there: nor shall I return to
England till after a few years' absence; in which time I hope
to become once more reconciled to the change of state I am
enjoined&mdash;a change I now most fervently wish could be
entirely dispensed with.</p>

<p>"The occasion of my remaining here a week longer, is to
settle some necessary affairs, among which the principal is,
that of delivering to a friend, a man of worth and of tenderness,
all those writings which have invested me with the
power of my guardianship&mdash;he will, the day after my departure,
(without one upbraiding word) resign them to you
in my name; and even your most respected father, could
he behold the resignation, would concur in its propriety.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear Miss Milner, let not affected resentment,
contempt, or levity, oppose that serenity, which, for
the week to come, I wish to enjoy. By complying with this
request, give me to believe, that, since you have been under
my care, you think I have, at least, faithfully discharged
some part of my duty. And wherever I have been inadequate
to your wishes, attribute my demerits to some infirmity
of mind, rather than to a negligence of your happiness. Yet,
be the cause what it will, since these faults have existed,
I do not attempt to disavow or extenuate them, and I beg
your pardon.</p>

<p>"However time, and a succession of objects, may eradicate
more tender sentiments, I am sure <i>never</i> to lose the liveliest
anxiety for your welfare&mdash;and with all that solicitude, which
cannot be described, I entreat for your own sake, for mine&mdash;when
we shall be far asunder&mdash;and for the sake of your dead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>father's memory, that, <i>upon every important occasion, you will
call your serious judgment to direct you</i>.</p>

<p>"I am, Madam,</p>

<p>"Your sincerest friend,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Elmwood</span>."</p></div>

<p>After she had read every syllable of this letter, it dropped
from her hands; but she uttered not a word. There was,
however, a paleness in her face, a deadness in her eye, and
a kind of palsy over her frame, which Miss Woodley, who
had seen her in every stage of her uneasiness, never had seen
before.</p>

<p>"I do not want to read the letter," said Miss Woodley;
"your looks tell me its contents."</p>

<p>"They will then discover to Lord Elmwood," replied she,
"what I feel; but Heaven forbid&mdash;that would sink me even
lower than I am."</p>

<p>Scarce able to move, she rose, and looked in her glass, as
if to arrange her features, and impose upon him: alas! it
was of no avail&mdash;a serenity of mind could alone effect what
she desired.</p>

<p>"You must endeavour," said Miss Woodley, "to feel the
disposition you wish to make appear."</p>

<p>"I will," replied she, "I will feel a proper pride&mdash;and
a proper scorn of this treatment."</p>

<p>And so desirous was she to attain the appearance of these
sentiments, that she made the strongest efforts to calm her
thoughts, in order to acquire it.</p>

<p>"I have but a few days to remain with him," she said to
herself, "and we part for ever&mdash;during those few days it
is not only my duty to obey his commands, or rather comply
with his request, but it is also my wish to leave upon his mind
an impression, which may not add to the ill opinion he has
formed of me, but, perhaps, serve to diminish it. If, in every
other instance, my conduct has been blameable, he shall, at
least in this, acknowledge its merit. The fate I have drawn
upon myself, he shall find I can be resigned to; and he shall
be convinced, that the woman, of whose weakness he has had
so many fatal proofs, is yet in possession of some fortitude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>&mdash;fortitude,
to bid him farewell, without discovering one
affected or one real pang, though her death should be the
immediate consequence."</p>

<p>Thus she resolved, and thus she acted. The severest judge
could not have arraigned her conduct, from the day she
received Lord Elmwood's letter, to the day of his departure.
She had, indeed, involuntary weaknesses, but none with which
she did not struggle, and, in general, her struggles were
victorious.</p>

<p>The first time she saw him after the receipt of his letter,
was on the evening of the same day&mdash;she had a little concert
of amateurs of music, and was herself singing and playing
when he entered the room: the connoisseurs immediately
perceived she made a false cadence&mdash;but Lord Elmwood was
no connoisseur in the art, and he did not observe it.</p>

<p>They occasionally spoke to each other through the evening,
but the subjects were general&mdash;and though their manners
every time they spoke, were perfectly polite, they were not
marked with the smallest degree of familiarity. To describe
his behaviour exactly, it was the same as his letter, polite,
friendly, composed, and resolved. Some of the company
staid supper, which prevented the embarrassment that must
unavoidably have arisen, had the family been by themselves.</p>

<p>The next morning each breakfasted in his separate apartments&mdash;more
company dined with them&mdash;in the evening,
and at supper, Lord Elmwood was from home.</p>

<p>Thus, all passed on as peaceably as he had requested, and
Miss Milner had not betrayed one particle of frailty; when,
the third day at dinner, some gentlemen of his acquaintance
being at table, one of them said,</p>

<p>"And so, my Lord, you absolutely set off on Tuesday
morning?"</p>

<p>This was Friday.</p>

<p>Sandford and he both replied at the same time, "Yes."
And Sandford, but not Lord Elmwood, looked at Miss
Milner when he spoke. Her knife and fork gave a sudden
spring in her hand, but no other emotion witnessed what
she felt.</p>

<p>"Aye, Elmwood," cried another gentleman at table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
"you'll bring home, I am afraid, a foreign wife, and that
I shan't forgive."</p>

<p>"It is his errand abroad, I make no doubt," said another
visitor.</p>

<p>Before he could return an answer, Sandford cried, "And
what objection to a foreigner for a wife? do not crowned
heads all marry foreigners? and who happier in the married
state than some kings?"</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood directed his eyes to the side of the table,
opposite to that where Miss Milner sat.</p>

<p>"Nay," (answered one of the guests, who was a country
gentleman) "what do you say, ladies&mdash;do you think my
Lord ought to go out of his own nation for a wife?" and
he looked at Miss Milner for the reply.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, uneasy at her friend's being thus forced
to give an opinion upon so delicate a subject, endeavoured
to satisfy the gentleman, by answering to the question herself:
"Whoever my Lord Elmwood marries, Sir," said Miss
Woodley, "he, no doubt, will be happy."</p>

<p>"But what say you, Madam?" asked the visitor, still
keeping his eyes on Miss Milner.</p>

<p>"That whoever Lord Elmwood marries, he <i>deserves</i> to be
happy:" returned she, with the utmost command of her
voice and looks; for Miss Woodley, by replying first, had
given her time to collect herself.</p>

<p>The colour flew to Lord Elmwood's face, as she delivered
this short sentence; and Miss Woodley persuaded herself,
she saw a tear start in his eye.</p>

<p>Miss Milner did not look that way.</p>

<p>In an instant he found means to change the subject, but
that of his journey still employed the conversation; and
what horses, servants, and carriages he took with him, was
minutely asked, and so accurately answered, either by himself
or by Mr. Sandford, that Miss Milner, although she had
known her doom before, till now had received no circumstantial
account of it&mdash;and as circumstances increase or
diminish all we feel, the hearing these things told, increased
the bitterness of their truth.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner the ladies retired; and from that time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
though Miss Milner's behaviour continued the same, yet her
looks and her voice were totally altered&mdash;for the world, she
could not have looked cheerfully; for the world, she could
not have spoken with a sprightly accent; she frequently
began in one, but not three words could she utter, before
her tones sunk into dejection. Not only her colour, but her
features became changed; her eyes lost their brilliancy, her
lips seemed to hang without the power of motion, her head
drooped, and her dress was neglected. Conscious of this
appearance, and conscious of the cause from whence it arose,
it was her desire to hide herself from the only object she
could have wished to have charmed. Accordingly, she sat
alone, or with Miss Woodley in her own apartment as much
as was consistent with that civility which her guardian had
requested, and which forbade her totally absenting herself.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley felt so acutely the torments of her friend,
that had not her reason told her, that the inflexible mind of
Lord Elmwood, was fixed beyond her power to shake, she
had cast herself at his feet, and implored the return of his
affection and tenderness, as the only means to save his once-beloved
ward from an untimely death. But her understanding&mdash;her
knowledge of his firm and immoveable temper; and
of all his provocations&mdash;her knowledge of his word, long since
given to Sandford, "That if once resolved, he would not
recall his resolution"&mdash;the certainty of the various plans
arranged for his travels, all convinced her, that by any
interference, she would only expose Miss Milner's love and
delicacy, to a contemptuous rejection.</p>

<p>If the conversation did not every day turn upon the subject
of Lord Elmwood's departure&mdash;a conversation he evidently
avoided himself&mdash;yet, every day, some new preparation for
his journey, struck either the ear or the eye of Miss Milner&mdash;and
had she beheld a frightful spectre, she could not have
shuddered with more horror, than when she unexpectedly
passed his large trunks in the hall, nailed and corded, ready
to be sent off to meet him at Venice. At the sight, she flew
from the company that chanced to be with her, and stole to
the first lonely corner of the house to conceal her tears&mdash;she
reclined her head upon her hands, and bedewed them with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the sudden anguish, that had overcome her. She heard
a footstep advancing towards the spot where she hoped to
have been concealed; she lifted up her eyes, and saw Lord
Elmwood. Pride, was the first emotion his presence inspired&mdash;pride,
which arose from the humility into which she was
plunged.</p>

<p>She looked at him earnestly, as if to imply, "What now,
my Lord?"</p>

<p>He only answered with a bow, which expressed; "I beg
your pardon." And immediately withdrew.</p>

<p>Thus each understood the other's language, without either
having uttered a word.</p>

<p>The just construction she put upon his looks and behaviour
upon this occasion, kept up her spirits for some little time;
and she blessed heaven, repeatedly, for the singular favour
of shewing to her, clearly, by this accident, his negligence of
her sorrows, his total indifference.</p>

<p>The next day was the eve of that on which he was to
depart&mdash;of the day on which she was to bid adieu to Dorriforth,
to her guardian, to Lord Elmwood; to all her hopes
at once.</p>

<p>The moment she awoke on Monday morning, the recollection,
that this was, perhaps, the last day she was ever again
to see him, softened all the resentment his yesterday's conduct
had raised: forgetting his austerity, and all she had
once termed cruelties, she now only remembered his friendship,
his tenderness, and his love. She was impatient to see
him, and promised herself, for this last day, to neglect no
one opportunity of being with him. For that purpose she
did not breakfast in her own room, as she had done for several
mornings before, but went into the breakfast-room, where
all the family in general met. She was rejoiced on hearing
his voice as she opened the door, yet the sound made her
tremble so much, that she could scarcely totter to the table.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley looked at her as she entered, and was never
so shocked at seeing her; for never had she yet seen her look
so ill. As she approached, she made an inclination of her
head to Mrs. Horton, then to her guardian, as was her
custom, when she first saw them in a morning&mdash;he looked in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
her face as he bowed in return, then fixed his eyes upon the
fire-place, rubbed his forehead, and began talking with
Mr. Sandford.</p>

<p>Sandford, during breakfast, by accident cast a glance upon
Miss Milner; his attention was caught by her deadly
countenance, and he looked earnestly. He then turned to
Lord Elmwood to see if he was observing her appearance&mdash;he
was not&mdash;and so much were her thoughts engaged on him
alone, that she did not once perceive Sandford gazing at her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horton, after a little while observed, "It was a
beautiful morning."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood said, "He thought he heard it rain in the
night."</p>

<p>Sandford cried, "For his part he slept too well to know."
And then (unasked) held a plate with biscuits to Miss Milner&mdash;it
was the first civility he had ever in his life offered her;
she smiled at the whimsicality of the circumstance, but she
took one in return for his attention. He looked grave beyond
his usual gravity, and yet not with his usual ill temper. She
did not eat what she had so politely taken, but laid it down
soon after.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood was the first who rose from breakfast, and
he did not return to dinner.</p>

<p>At dinner, Mrs. Horton said, "She hoped he would, however,
favour them with his company at supper."</p>

<p>To which Sandford replied, "No doubt, for you will
hardly any of you see him in the morning; as we shall be off
by six, or soon after."</p>

<p>Sandford was not going abroad with Lord Elmwood, but
was to go with him as far as Dover.</p>

<p>These words of his&mdash;"<i>Not see Lord Elmwood in the morning</i>"&mdash;[never
again to see him after this evening,] were like the
knell of death to Miss Milner. She felt the symptoms of
fainting, and eagerly snatched a glass of water, which the
servant was holding to Sandford, who had called for it, and
drank it off;&mdash;as she returned the glass to the servant, she
began to apologize to Mr. Sandford for her seeming rudeness,
but before she could utter what she intended, he said, good-naturedly,
"Never mind&mdash;you are very welcome&mdash;I am glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
you took it." She looked at him to observe, whether he had
really spoken kindly, or ironically; but before his countenance
could satisfy her, her thoughts were called away from that
trivial matter, and again fixed upon Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>The moments seemed tedious till he came home to supper,
and yet, when she reflected how short the remainder of the
evening would be after that time, she wished to defer the
hour of his return for months. At ten o'clock he arrived;
and at half after ten the family, without any visitor, met at
supper.</p>

<p>Miss Milner had considered, that the period for her to
counterfeit appearances, was diminished now to a most contracted
one; and she rigorously enjoined herself not to
shrink from the little which remained. The certain end, that
would be so soon put to this painful deception, encouraged
her to struggle through it with redoubled zeal; and this
was but necessary, as her weakness increased. She therefore
listened, she talked, and even smiled with the rest of the
company, nor did <i>their</i> vivacity seem to arise, from a much
less compulsive source than her own.</p>

<p>It was past twelve, when Lord Elmwood looked at his
watch, and rising from his chair, went up to Mrs. Horton,
and taking her hand, said, "Till I see you again, Madam,
I sincerely wish you every happiness."</p>

<p>Miss Milner fixed her eyes upon the table before her.</p>

<p>"My Lord," replied Mrs. Horton, "I sincerely wish you
health and happiness likewise."</p>

<p>He then went to Miss Woodley, and taking her hand,
repeated much the same, as he had said to Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>Miss Milner now trembled beyond all power of concealment.</p>

<p>"My Lord," replied Miss Woodley, a good deal affected, "I
sincerely hope my prayers for your happiness may be heard."</p>

<p>She and Mrs. Horton were both standing as well as Lord
Elmwood; but Miss Milner kept her seat, till his eye was
turned upon her, and he moved slowly towards her; she
then rose:&mdash;every one who was present, attentive to what
he would now say, and how she would receive what he said,
here cast their eyes upon them, and listened with impatience.
They were all disappointed&mdash;he did not utter a syllable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Yet he took her hand, and held it closely between his. He
then bowed most respectfully and left her.</p>

<p>No "I wish you well;&mdash;I wish you health and happiness."
No "Prayers for blessings on her." Not even the word
"Farewell," escaped his lips&mdash;perhaps, to have attempted
any of these, might have choaked his utterance.</p>

<p>She had behaved with fortitude the whole evening, and
she continued to do so, till the moment he turned away
from her. Her eyes then overflowed with tears, and in the
agony of her mind, not knowing what she did, she laid her
cold hand upon the person next to her&mdash;it happened to be
Sandford; but not observing it was he, she grasped his hand
with violence&mdash;yet he did not snatch it away, nor look at
her with his wonted severity. And thus she stood, silent and
motionless, while Lord Elmwood, now at the door, bowed
once more to all the company, and retired.</p>

<p>Sandford had still Miss Milner's hand fixed upon his; and
when the door was shut after Lord Elmwood, he turned his
head to look in her face, and turned it with some marks of
apprehension for the grief he might find there. She strove
to overcome that grief, and after a heavy sigh, sat down, as
if resigned to the fate to which she was decreed.</p>

<p>Instead of following Lord Elmwood, as usual, Sandford
poured out a glass of wine, and drank it. A general silence
ensued for near three minutes. At last, turning himself
round on his seat, towards Miss Milner, who sat like a statue
of despair at his side, "Will you breakfast with us to-morrow?"
said he.</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>"We shan't breakfast before half after six," continued he,
"I dare say; and if you can rise so early&mdash;why do."</p>

<p>"Miss Milner," said Miss Woodley, (for she caught
eagerly at the hope of her passing this night in less unhappiness
than she had foreboded) "pray rise at that hour to
breakfast; Mr. Sandford would not invite you, if he thought
it would displease Lord Elmwood."</p>

<p>"Not I," replied Sandford, churlishly.</p>

<p>"Then desire her maid to call her:" said Mrs. Horton
to Miss Woodley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, she will be awake, I have no doubt;" returned
her niece.</p>

<p>"No;" replied Miss Milner, "since Lord Elmwood has
thought proper to take his leave of me, without even speaking
a word; by my own design, never will I see him again." And
her tears burst forth, as if her heart burst at the same time.</p>

<p>"Why did not <i>you</i> speak to <i>him</i>?" cried Sandford&mdash;"Pray
did <i>you</i> bid <i>him</i> farewell? and I don't see why one is
not as much to be blamed, in that respect, as the other."</p>

<p>"I was too weak to say I wished him happy," cried Miss
Milner; "but, Heaven is my witness, I do wish him so from
my soul."</p>

<p>"And do you imagine he does not wish you so?" cried
Sandford. "You should judge him by your own heart; and
what you feel for him, imagine he feels for you, my dear."</p>

<p>Though "<i>my dear</i>" is a trivial phrase, yet from certain
people, and upon certain occasions, it is a phrase of infinite
comfort and assurance. Mr. Sandford seldom said "my dear"
to any one; to Miss Milner never; and upon this occasion,
and from him, it was an expression most precious.</p>

<p>She turned to him with a look of gratitude; but as she
only looked, and did not speak, he rose up, and soon after
said, with a friendly tone he had seldom used in her presence,
"I sincerely wish you a good night."</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, Miss Milner exclaimed, "However
my fate may have been precipitated by the unkindness of
Mr. Sandford, yet, for that particle of concern which he has
shown for me this night, I will always be grateful to him."</p>

<p>"Ay," cried Mrs. Horton, "good Mr. Sandford may
show his kindness now, without any danger from its consequences.
Now Lord Elmwood is going away for ever, he
is not afraid of your seeing him once again." And she
thought she praised him by this suggestion.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When Miss Milner retired to her bed-chamber, Miss
Woodley went with her, nor would leave her the whole night&mdash;but
in vain did she persuade her to rest&mdash;she absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
refused; and declared she would never, from that hour,
indulge repose. "The part I undertook to perform," cried
she, "is over&mdash;I will now, for my whole life, appear in my
own character, and give a loose to the anguish I endure."</p>

<p>As daylight showed itself&mdash;"And yet I might see him once
again," said she&mdash;"I might see him within these two hours,
if I pleased, for Mr. Sandford invited me."</p>

<p>"If you think, my dear Miss Milner," said Miss Woodley,
"that a second parting from Lord Elmwood would but give
you a second agony, in the name of Heaven do not see him
any more&mdash;but, if you hope your mind would be easier, were
you to bid each other adieu in a more direct manner than
you did last night, let us go down and breakfast with him.
I'll go before, and prepare him for your reception&mdash;you shall
not surprise him&mdash;and I will let him know, it is by Mr. Sandford's
invitation you are coming."</p>

<p>She listened with a smile to this proposal, yet objected to
the indelicacy of her wishing to see him, after he had taken
his leave&mdash;but as Miss Woodley perceived that she was
inclined to infringe this delicacy, of which she had so proper
a sense, she easily persuaded her, it was impossible for the
most suspicious person (and Lord Elmwood was far from
such a character) to suppose, that the paying him a visit
at that period of time, could be with the most distant idea of
regaining his heart, or of altering one resolution he had taken.</p>

<p>But though Miss Milner acquiesced in this opinion, yet
she had not the courage to form the determination that she
would go.</p>

<p>Daylight now no longer peeped, but stared upon them.
Miss Milner went to the looking-glass, breathed upon her
hands and rubbed them on her eyes, smoothed her hair and
adjusted her dress; yet said, after all, "I dare not see him
again."</p>

<p>"You may do as you please," said Miss Woodley, "but
I will. I that have lived for so many years under the same
roof with him, and on the most friendly terms, and he going
away, perhaps for these ten years, perhaps for ever, I should
think it a disrespect not to see him to the last moment of his
remaining in the house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then do you go," said Miss Milner, eagerly; "and if he
should ask for me, I will gladly come, you know; but if he
does not ask for me, I will not&mdash;and pray don't deceive me."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley promised her not to deceive her; and soon
after, as they heard the servants pass about the house, and
the clock had struck six, Miss Woodley went to the breakfast
room.</p>

<p>She found Lord Elmwood there in his travelling dress,
standing pensively by the fire-place&mdash;and, as he did not
dream of seeing her, he started when she entered, and, with
an appearance of alarm, said, "Dear Miss Woodley, what's
the matter?" She replied, "Nothing, my Lord; but I could
not be satisfied without seeing your Lordship once again,
while I had it in my power."</p>

<p>"I thank you," he returned with a sigh&mdash;the heaviest and
most intelligent sigh she ever heard him condescend to give.
She imagined, alas, that he looked as if he wished to ask how
Miss Milner did, but would not allow himself the indulgence.
She was half inclined to mention her to him, and was debating
in her mind whether she should or not, when Mr. Sandford
came into the room, saying, as he entered,</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, my Lord, where did you sleep last
night?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask!" said he.</p>

<p>"Because," replied Sandford, "I went into your bed-chamber
just now, and I found your bed made. You have
not slept there to-night."</p>

<p>"I have slept no where," returned he; "I could not
sleep&mdash;and having some papers to look over, and to set off
early, I thought I might as well not go to bed at all."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was pleased at the frank manner in which
he made this confession, and could not resist the strong
impulse to say, "You have done just then, my Lord, like
Miss Milner, for she has not been in bed the whole night."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley spoke this in a negligent manner, and yet,
Lord Elmwood echoed back the words with solicitude,
"Has not Miss Milner been in bed the whole night?"</p>

<p>"If she is up, why does not she come and take some coffee?"
said Sandford, as he began to pour it out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"If she thought it would be agreeable," returned Miss
Woodley, "I dare say she would." And she looked at Lord
Elmwood while she spoke, though she did not absolutely
address him; but he made no reply.</p>

<p>"Agreeable!" returned Sandford, angrily&mdash;"Has she
then a quarrel with any body here? or does she suppose any
body here bears enmity to <i>her</i>? Is she not in peace and
charity?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Miss Woodley, "that I am sure she is."</p>

<p>"Then bring her hither," cried Sandford, "directly.
Would she have the wickedness to imagine we are not all
friends with her?"</p>

<p>Miss Woodley left the room, and found Miss Milner almost
in despair, lest she should hear Lord Elmwood's carriage
drive off before her friend's return.</p>

<p>"Did he send for me?" were the words she uttered as
soon as she saw her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford did, in his presence," returned Miss
Woodley, "and you may go with the utmost decorum, or
I would not tell you so."</p>

<p>She required no protestations of this, but readily followed
her beloved adviser, whose kindness never appeared in so
amiable a light as at that moment.</p>

<p>On entering the room, through all the dead white of her
present complection, she blushed to a crimson. Lord Elmwood
rose from his seat, and brought a chair for her to sit
down.</p>

<p>Sandford looked at her inquisitively, sipped his tea, and
said, "He never made tea to his own liking."</p>

<p>Miss Milner took a cup, but had scarce strength to hold it.</p>

<p>It seemed but a very short time they were at breakfast,
when the carriage, that was to take Lord Elmwood away,
drove to the door. Miss Milner started at the sound&mdash;so
did he&mdash;but she had nearly dropped her cup and saucer; on
which Sandford took them out of her hand, saying,</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had rather have coffee?"</p>

<p>Her lips moved, but he could not hear what she said.</p>

<p>A servant came in, and told Lord Elmwood, "The carriage
was at the door."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>He replied, "Very well." But though he had breakfasted,
he did not attempt to move.</p>

<p>At last, rising briskly, as if it was necessary to go in haste
when he did go; he took up his hat, which he had brought
with him into the room, and was turning to Miss Woodley
to take his leave, when Sandford cried, "My Lord, you are
in a great hurry." And then, as if he wished to give poor
Miss Milner every moment he could, added, (looking about)
"I don't know where I have laid my gloves."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood, after repeating to Miss Woodley his last
night's farewell, now went up to Miss Milner, and taking one
of her hands, again held it between his, but still without
speaking&mdash;while she, unable to suppress her tears as heretofore,
suffered them to fall in torrents.</p>

<p>"What is all this?" cried Sandford, going up to them in
anger.</p>

<p>They neither of them replied, or changed their situation.</p>

<p>"Separate this moment," cried Sandford, "or resolve to
be separated only by&mdash;death."</p>

<p>The commanding and awful manner in which he spoke
this sentence, made them both turn to him in amazement,
and as it were, petrified with the sensation his words had
caused.</p>

<p>He left them for a moment, and going to a small bookcase
in one corner of the room, took out of it a book, and returning
with it in his hand, said,</p>

<p>"Lord Elmwood, do you love this woman?"</p>

<p>"More than my life." He replied, with the most heartfelt
accents.</p>

<p>He then turned to Miss Milner&mdash;"Can you say the same
by him?"</p>

<p>She spread her hands over her eyes, and exclaimed, "Oh,
Heavens!"</p>

<p>"I believe you <i>can</i> say so," returned Sandford; "and in
the name of God, and your own happiness, since this is the
state of you both, let me put it out of your power to part."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood gazed at him with wonder! and yet, as if
enraptured by the sudden change this conduct gave to his
prospects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>She, sighed with a kind of trembling ecstasy; while Sandford,
with all the dignity of his official character, delivered
these words&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord, while I thought my counsel might save you
from the worst of misfortunes, conjugal strife, I importuned
you hourly, and set forth your danger in the light it appeared
to me. But though old, and a priest, I can submit to think
I have been in an error; and I now firmly believe, it is for
the welfare of you both, to become man and wife. My Lord,
take this woman's marriage vows&mdash;you can ask no fairer
promises of her reform&mdash;she can give you none half so sacred,
half so binding; and I see by her looks that she will mean
to keep them. And my dear," continued he, addressing
himself to her, "act but under the dominion of those vows,
to a husband of sense and virtue, like him, and you will be
all that I, himself, or even Heaven can desire. Now, then,
Lord Elmwood, this moment give her up for ever, or this
moment constrain her by such ties from offending you, as
she shall not <i>dare</i> to violate."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood struck his forehead in doubt and agitation;
but, still holding her hand, he cried, "I cannot part from
her." Then feeling this reply as equivocal, he fell upon his
knees, and cried, "Will you pardon my hesitation? and will
you, in marriage, show me that tender love you have not
shown me yet? Will you, in possessing all my affections,
bear with all my infirmities?"</p>

<p>She raised him from her feet, and by the expression of her
countenance, by the tears that bathed his hands, gave him
confidence.</p>

<p>He turned to Sandford&mdash;then placing her by his own side,
as the form of matrimony requires, gave this for a sign to
Sandford that he should begin the ceremony. On which,
he opened his book, and&mdash;married them.</p>

<p>With voice and manners so serious, so solemn and so fervent,
he performed these rites, that every idea of jest, or even of
lightness, was absent from the mind of all who were present.</p>

<p>Miss Milner, covered with shame, sunk on the bosom of
Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>When the ring was wanting, Lord Elmwood supplied it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
with one from his own hand, but throughout all the rest of
the ceremony, appeared lost in zealous devotion to Heaven.
Yet, no sooner was it finished, than his thoughts descended
to this world. He embraced his bride with all the transport
of the fondest, happiest bridegroom, and in raptures called
her by the endearing name of "wife."</p>

<p>"But still, my Lord," cried Sandford, "you are only
married by your own church and conscience, not by your
wife's, or by the law of the land; and let me advise you not
to defer that marriage long, lest in the time you disagree, and
she should refuse to become your legal spouse."</p>

<p>"I think there is danger," returned Lord Elmwood, "and
therefore our second marriage must take place to-morrow."</p>

<p>To this the ladies objected, and Sandford was to fix their
second wedding-day, as he had done their first. He, after
consideration, gave them four days.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley then recollected (for every one else had
forgot it) that the carriage was still at the door to convey
Lord Elmwood far away. It was of course dismissed&mdash;and
one of those great incidents of delight which Miss Milner
that morning tasted, was to look out of the window, and see
this very carriage drive from the door unoccupied.</p>

<p>Never was there a more rapid change from despair to
happiness&mdash;to happiness perfect and supreme&mdash;than was
that, which Miss Milner and Lord Elmwood experienced in
one single hour.</p>

<p>The few days that intervened between this and their
lawful marriage, were passed in the delightful care of preparing
for that happy day&mdash;yet, with all its delights inferior
to the first, when every unexpected joy was doubled by the
once expected sorrow.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on that first wedding-day, that joyful day,
which restored her lost lover to her hopes again; even on that
<i>very</i> day, after the sacred ceremony was over, Miss Milner&mdash;(with
all the fears, the tremors, the superstition of her sex)&mdash;felt
an excruciating shock; when, looking on the ring Lord
Elmwood had put upon her finger, in haste, when he married
her, she perceived it was a&mdash;mourning ring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h2>A SIMPLE STORY.</h2>

<a name="III_CHAPTER_I" id="III_CHAPTER_I"></a><h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Not any event, throughout life, can arrest the reflection
of a thoughtful mind more powerfully, or leave so lasting an
impression, as that of returning to a place after a few years
absence, and observing an entire alteration, in respect to all
the persons who once formed the neighbourhood. To find
that many, who but a few years before were left in their
bloom of youth and health, are dead&mdash;to find that children
left at school, are married and have children of their own&mdash;that
some, who were left in riches, are reduced to poverty&mdash;that
others, who were in poverty are become rich&mdash;to find,
those once renowned for virtue, now detested for vice&mdash;roving
husbands, grown constant&mdash;constant husbands, become
rovers&mdash;the firmest friends, changed to the most
implacable enemies&mdash;beauty faded. In a word, every change
to demonstrate, that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All is transitory on this side the grave."</p></div>

<p>Guided by a wish, that the reflecting reader may experience
the sensation, which an attention to circumstances like these,
must excite; he is desired to imagine seventeen years
elapsed, since he has seen or heard of any of those persons
who in the foregoing volumes have been introduced to his
acquaintance&mdash;and then, supposing himself at the period of
those seventeen years, follow the sequel of their history.</p>

<p>To begin with the first female object of this story. The
beautiful, the beloved Miss Milner&mdash;she is no longer beautiful&mdash;no
longer beloved&mdash;no longer&mdash;tremble while you read it!&mdash;no
longer&mdash;virtuous.</p>

<p>Dorriforth, the pious, the good, the tender Dorriforth, is
become a hard-hearted tyrant. The compassionate, the
feeling, the just Lord Elmwood, an example of implacable
rigour and injustice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Woodley is grown old, but less with years than grief.</p>

<p>The boy, Rushbrook, is become a man, and the apparent
heir of Lord Elmwood's fortune; while his own daughter,
his only child by his once adored Miss Milner, he refuses
ever to see again, in vengeance to her mother's crimes.</p>

<p>The least wonderful change, is, the death of Mrs. Horton.
Except Sandford, who remains much the same as heretofore.</p>

<p>We left Lady Elmwood in the last volume at the summit
of human happiness; a loving and beloved bride. We begin
this volume, and find her upon her death-bed.</p>

<p>At thirty-five, her "Course was run"&mdash;a course full of
perils, of hopes, of fears, of joys, and at the end, of sorrows;
all exquisite of their kind, for exquisite were the feelings of
her susceptible heart.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this story, her father is described
in the last moments of his life, with all his cares fixed upon
her, his only child&mdash;how vain these cares! how vain every
precaution that was taken for her welfare! She knows, she
reflects upon this; and yet, impelled by that instinctive
power which actuates a parent, Lady Elmwood on <i>her</i> dying
day has no worldly thoughts, but that of the future happiness
of an only child. To every other prospect in her view, "Thy
will be done" is her continual exclamation; but where the
misery of her daughter presents itself, the expiring penitent
would there combat the will of Heaven.</p>

<p>To detail the progression by which vice gains a predominancy
in the heart, may be a useful lesson; but it is one
so little to the satisfaction of most readers, that the degrees
of misconduct by which Lady Elmwood fell, are not meant
to be related here; but instead of picturing every occasion
of her fall, to come briefly to the events that followed.</p>

<p>There are, nevertheless, some articles under the former
class, which ought not to be entirely omitted.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood, after four years enjoyment of the most
perfect happiness that marriage could give, after becoming
the father of a beautiful daughter, whom he loved with
a tenderness almost equal to his love of her mother, was under
the indispensable necessity of leaving them both for a time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
in order to rescue from the depredation of his own steward,
his very large estates in the West Indies. His voyage was
tedious; his residence there, from various accidents, prolonged
from time to time, till near three years had at length
passed away. Lady Elmwood, at first only unhappy, became
at last provoked; and giving way to that irritable disposition
which she had so seldom governed, resolved, in spite of his
injunctions, to divert the melancholy hours caused by his
absence, by mixing in the gay circles of London.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood at this time, and for many months before,
had been detained abroad by a severe and dangerous illness,
which a too cautious fear of her uneasiness, had prompted
him to conceal; and she received his frequent apologies for
not returning, with a suspicion and resentment they were
calculated, but not intended, to inspire.</p>

<p>To violent anger, succeeded a degree of indifference still
more fatal&mdash;Lady Elmwood's heart was not formed for such
a state&mdash;there, where all the tumultuous passions harboured
by turns, one among them soon found the means to occupy
all vacancies: a passion, commencing innocently, but
terminating in guilt. The dear object of her fondest, her
truest affections, was away; and those affections, painted
the time so irksome that was past; so wearisome, that, which
was still to come; that she flew from the present tedious
solitude, to the dangerous society of one, whose whole mind
depraved by fashionable vices, could not repay her for
a moment's loss of him, whose absence he supplied. Or,
if the delirium gave her a moment's recompence, what were
her sufferings, her remorse, when she was awakened from
the fleeting joy, by the arrival of her husband? How happy,
how transporting would have been that arrival a few months
before! As it would then have been felicity unbounded, it
was now&mdash;language affords no word that can describe Lady
Elmwood's sensations, on being told her Lord was arrived,
and that necessity alone had so long delayed his return.</p>

<p>Guilty, but not hardened in her guilt, her pangs, her
shame were the more excessive. She fled from the place at
his approach; fled from his house, never again to return
to a habitation where he was the master. She did not, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ever,
elope with her paramour, but escaped to shelter herself
in the most dreary retreat; where she partook of no one
comfort from society, or from life, but the still unremitting
friendship of Miss Woodley. Even her infant daughter she
left behind, nor would allow herself the consolation of her
innocent, though reproachful smiles&mdash;she left her in her
father's house, that she might be under his protection;
parted with her, as she thought, for ever, with all the
agonies with which mothers part from their infant children:
and yet, even a mother can scarce conceive how much more
sharp those agonies were, on beholding&mdash;the child sent after
her, as the perpetual outcast of its father.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood's love to his wife had been extravagant&mdash;the
effect of his hate was the same. Beholding himself
separated from her by a barrier never to be removed, he
vowed in the deep torments of his revenge, never to be
reminded of her by one individual object; much less, by one
so near to her as her child. To bestow upon that child his
affections, would be, he imagined, still, in some sort, to divide
them with the mother. Firm in his resolution, the beautiful
Matilda, was, at the age of six years, sent out of her father's
house, and received by her mother with all the tenderness,
but with all the anguish, of those parents, who behold their
offspring visited by the punishment due only to their own
offences.</p>

<p>While this rigid act was executing by Lord Elmwood's
agents at his command, himself was engaged in an affair of
still weightier importance&mdash;that of life or death:&mdash;he
determined upon his own death, or the death of the man
who had wounded his honour and destroyed his happiness.
A duel with his old antagonist was the result of this determination;
nor was the Duke of Avon (who before the
decease of his father and eldest brother, was Lord Frederick
Lawnly) averse from giving him all the satisfaction he
required. For it was no other than he, whose passion for
Lady Elmwood had still subsisted, and whose address in
gallantry left no means unattempted for the success of his
designs;&mdash;no other than he, (who, next to Lord Elmwood,
had been of all her lovers, the most favoured,) to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Lady Elmwood sacrificed her own and her husband's future
peace, and thus gave to his vanity a prouder triumph, than
if she had never bestowed her hand in marriage on another.
This triumph however was but short&mdash;a month only, after
the return of Lord Elmwood, the Duke was called upon to
answer for his conduct, and was left where they met, so
defaced with scars, as never again to endanger the honour
of a husband. As Lord Elmwood was inexorable to all
accommodation, their engagement continued for a long
space of time; nor could any thing but the assurance that
his opponent was slain, have at last torn him from the field,
though he himself was dangerously wounded.</p>

<p>Yet even during the period of his danger, while for days he
lay in the continual expectation of his own death, not all the
entreaties of his dearest, most intimate, and most respected
friends, could prevail upon him to pronounce forgiveness
of his wife, or to suffer them to bring his daughter to him,
for his last blessing.</p>

<p>Lady Elmwood, who was made acquainted with the
minutest circumstance as it passed, appeared to wait the news
of her husband's decease with patience; but upon her brow,
and in every lineament of her face was marked, that his
death was an event she would not for a day survive: and
she would have left her child an orphan, to have followed
Lord Elmwood to the tomb. She was prevented the trial;
he recovered; and from the ample vengeance he had obtained
upon the irresistible person of the Duke, in a short
time seemed to regain his usual tranquillity.</p>

<p>He recovered, but Lady Elmwood fell sick and languished&mdash;possessed
of youth to struggle with her woes, she lingered
on, till ten years decline brought her to that period, with
which the reader is now going to be presented.</p>

<h2><a name="III_CHAPTER_II" id="III_CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>In a lonely country on the borders of Scotland, a single
house by the side of a dreary heath, was the residence of the
once gay, volatile Miss Milner. In a large gloomy apartment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of this solitary habitation (the windows of which scarce
rendered the light accessible) was laid upon her death-bed,
the once lovely Lady Elmwood&mdash;pale, half suffocated with
the loss of breath; yet her senses perfectly clear and collected,
which served but to sharpen the anguish of dying.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room, by the side of an old fashioned
stool, kneels Miss Woodley, praying most devoutly for her
still beloved friend, but in vain endeavouring to pray composedly&mdash;floods
of tears pour down her furrowed cheeks,
and frequent sobs of sorrow, break through each pious
ejaculation.</p>

<p>Close by her mother's side, one hand supporting her head,
the other wiping from her face the cold dew of death, behold
Lady Elmwood's daughter&mdash;Lord Elmwood's daughter too&mdash;yet
he far away, negligent of what either suffers. Lady
Elmwood turns to her often and attempts an embrace, but
her feeble arms forbid, and they fall motionless. The
daughter perceiving these ineffectual efforts, has her whole
face convulsed with grief: kisses her mother; holds her to
her bosom; and hangs upon her neck, as if she wished to
cling there, not to be parted even by the grave.</p>

<p>On the other side of the bed sits Sandford&mdash;his hair grown
white&mdash;his face wrinkled with age&mdash;his heart the same as
ever.&mdash;The reprover, the enemy of the vain, the idle, and
the wicked; but the friend and comforter of the forlorn
and miserable.</p>

<p>Upon those features where sarcasm, reproach, and anger
dwelt, to threaten and alarm the sinner; mildness, tenderness,
and pity beamed, to support and console the penitent.
Compassion changed his language, and softened all those
harsh tones that used to denounce perdition.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," said he to Lady Elmwood, "of
that God, who suffered for you, and, suffering, knew and
pitied all our weaknesses&mdash;By him, who has given his word to
<i>take compassion on the sinner's tears</i>, I bid you hope for mercy.
By that innocence in which you once lived, be comforted&mdash;By
the sorrows you have known since your degradation,
hope, that in some measure, you have atoned&mdash;- By the sincerity
that shone upon your youthful face when I joined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
your hands, and those thousand virtues you have since given
proofs of, trust, that you were not born to die <i>the death of
the wicked</i>."</p>

<p>As he spoke these words of consolation, her trembling
hand clasped his&mdash;her dying eyes darted a ray of brightness&mdash;but
her failing voice endeavoured in vain, to articulate. At
length, fixing her looks upon her daughter as their last
dear object, she was just understood to utter the word
"Father."</p>

<p>"I understand you," replied Sandford, "and by all that
influence I ever had over him, by my prayers, my tears,"
(and they flowed as he spoke) "I will implore him to own
his child."</p>

<p>She could now only smile in thanks.</p>

<p>"And if I should fail," continued he, "yet while I live,
she shall not want a friend or protector&mdash;all an old man, like
me can answer for"&mdash;&mdash;here his tears interrupted him.</p>

<p>Lady Elmwood was sufficiently sensible of his words and
their import, to make a sign as if she wished to embrace him:
but finding her life leaving her fast, she reserved this last
token of love for her daughter&mdash;with a struggle she lifted herself
from her pillow, clung to her child&mdash;and died in her
arms.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Lord Elmwood was by nature, and more from education,
of a serious, thinking, and philosophic turn of mind. His
religious studies had completely taught him to consider this
world but as a passage to another; to enjoy with gratitude
what Heaven in its bounty should bestow, and to bear with
submission, whatever in its vengeance it might inflict. In
a greater degree than most people he practised this doctrine;
and as soon as the shock he received from Lady Elmwood's
conduct was abated, an entire calmness and resignation
ensued; but still of that sensible and feeling kind, that could
never suffer him to forget the happiness he had lost; and it
was this sensibility, which urged him to fly from its more
keen recollection as much as possible&mdash;this, he alleged as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the reason why he would never permit Lady Elmwood, or
even her child, to be named in his hearing. But this injunction
(which all his friends, and even the servants in the house
who attended his person, had received) was, by many people,
suspected rather to proceed from his resentment, than his
tenderness; nor did he deny, that resentment co-operated
with his prudence: for prudence he called it, not to remind
himself of happiness he could never taste again, and of
ingratitude that might impel him to hatred: and prudence
he called it, not to form another attachment near to his heart,
more especially so near as a parent's which might again
expose him to all the torments of ingratitude, from an object
whom he affectionately loved.</p>

<p>Upon these principles he formed the unshaken resolution,
never to acknowledge Lady Matilda as his child&mdash;or acknowledging
her as such&mdash;never to see, to hear of, or take one
concern whatever in her fate and fortune. The death of her
mother appeared a favourable time, had he been so inclined,
to have recalled this declaration which he had solemnly and
repeatedly made&mdash;she was now destitute of the protection
of her other parent, and it became his duty, at least, to provide
her a guardian, if he did not chuse to take that tender title
upon himself&mdash;but to mention either the mother or child to
Lord Elmwood, was an equal offence, and prohibited in the
strongest terms to all his friends and household; and as he
was an excellent good master, a sincere friend, and a most
generous patron, not one of his acquaintance or dependants,
were hardy enough to draw upon themselves his certain
displeasure, which was always violent in the extreme, by
even the official intelligence of Lady Elmwood's death.</p>

<p>Sandford himself, intimidated through age, or by the
austere, and morose manners which Lord Elmwood had of
late years adopted; Sandford wished, if possible, that some
other would undertake the dangerous task of recalling to his
memory there ever was such a person as his wife. He advised
Miss Woodley to write a proper letter to him on the subject;
but she reminded him that such a step would be more perilous
to her, than to any other person, as she was the most destitute
being on earth, without the benevolence of Lord Elmwood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
The death of her aunt, Mrs. Horton, had left her solely
relying on the bounty of Lady Elmwood, and now her death,
had left her totally dependant upon the Earl&mdash;for Lady
Elmwood though she had separate effects, had long before
her death declared it was not her intention to leave a sentence
behind her in the form of a will. She had no will, she said,
but what she would wholly submit to Lord Elmwood's;
and, if it were even his will, that her child should live in
poverty, as well as banishment, it should be so. But, perhaps,
in this implicit submission to him, there was a distant hope,
that the necessitous situation of his daughter, might plead
more forcibly than his parental love; and that knowing her
bereft of every support but through himself, that idea might
form some little tie between them, and be at least a token
of the relationship.</p>

<p>But as Lady Elmwood anxiously wished this principle upon
which she acted, should be concealed from his suspicion, she
included her friend, Miss Woodley, in the same fate; and
thus, the only persons dear to her, she left, but at Lord
Elmwood's pleasure, to be preserved from perishing in want.
Her child was too young to advise her on this subject, her
friend too disinterested; and at this moment they were
both without the smallest means of subsistence, except
through the justice or compassion of Lord Elmwood. Sandford
had indeed promised his protection to the daughter;
but his liberality had no other source than from his patron,
with whom he still lived as usual, except during part of the
winter, when the Earl resided in town; he then mostly stole
a visit to Lady Elmwood.&mdash;On this last visit he staid to see
her buried.</p>

<p>After some mature deliberations, Sandford was now
preparing to go to Lord Elmwood at his house in town, and
there, to deliver himself the news that must sooner or later
be told; and he meant also to venture, at the same time,
to keep the promise he had made to his dying Lady&mdash;but
the news reached his Lordship before Sandford arrived; it
was announced in the public papers, and by that means first
came to his knowledge.</p>

<p>He was breakfasting by himself, when the newspaper that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
first gave the intelligence of Lady Elmwood's death, was
laid before him&mdash;the paragraph contained these words:</p>

<p>"On Wednesday last died, at Dring Park, a village in
Northumberland, the right honourable Countess Elmwood.&mdash;This
lady, who has not been heard of for many years in the
fashionable world, was a rich heiress, and of extreme beauty;
but although she received overtures from many men of the
first rank, she preferred her guardian, the present Lord
Elmwood (then Mr. Dorriforth) to them all&mdash;and it is said,
their marriage was followed by an uncommon share of felicity,
till his Lordship going abroad, and remaining there some
time, the consequences (to a most captivating young woman
left without a protector) were such as to cause a separation on
his return. Her Ladyship has left one child by the Earl,
a daughter, about fifteen."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood had so much feeling upon reading this, as
to lay down the paper, and not take it up again for several
minutes&mdash;nor did he taste his chocolate during this interval,
but leaned his elbow on the table and rested his head upon
his hand. He then rose up&mdash;walked two or three times across
the room&mdash;sat down again&mdash;took up the paper&mdash;and read as
usual.&mdash;Nor let the vociferous mourner, or the perpetual
weeper, here complain of his want of sensibility&mdash;but let
them remember that Lord Elmwood was a man&mdash;a man of
understanding&mdash;of courage&mdash;of fortitude&mdash;above all, a man
of the nicest feelings&mdash;and who shall say, but that at the
time he leaned his head upon his hand, and rose to walk away
the sense of what he felt, he might not feel as much as Lady
Elmwood did in her last moments.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, his susceptibility on the occasion was not
suspected by any one&mdash;yet he passed that day the same as
usual; the next day too, and the day after. On the morning
of the fourth, he sent for his steward to his study, and after
talking of other business, said to him;</p>

<p>"Is it true that Lady Elmwood is dead?"</p>

<p>"It is, my Lord."</p>

<p>His Lordship looked unusually grave, and at this reply,
fetched an involuntary sigh.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford, my lord," continued the steward, "sent me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
word of the news, but left it to my own discretion, whether
I would make your Lordship acquainted with it or not:
I let him know I declined."</p>

<p>"Where is Sandford?" asked Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"He was with my Lady," replied the steward.</p>

<p>"When she died?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it&mdash;he will see that every thing she desired
is done&mdash;Sandford is a good man, and would be a friend to
every body."</p>

<p>"He is a very good man indeed, my Lord."</p>

<p>There was now a silence.&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Giffard then bowing, said,
"Has your Lordship any further commands?"</p>

<p>"Write to Sandford," said Lord Elmwood, hesitating as
he spoke, "and tell him to have every thing performed as
she desired. And whoever she may have selected for the
guardian of her child, has my consent to act as such.&mdash;Nor
in one instance, where I myself am not concerned, shall
I oppose her will." The tears rushed into his eyes as he said
this, and caused them to start in the steward's&mdash;observing
which, he sternly resumed,</p>

<p>"Do not suppose from this conversation, that any of those
resolutions I have long since taken, are, or will be changed&mdash;they
are the same; and shall continue inflexible."</p>

<p>"I understand you, my Lord," replied Mr. Giffard, "your
express orders, to me, as well as to every other person, remain
just the same as formerly, never to mention this subject to
you again."</p>

<p>"They do, Sir."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I always obeyed you, and hope I always shall."</p>

<p>"I hope so too," he replied in a threatening accent&mdash;"Write
to Sandford," continued he, "to let him know my
pleasure, and that is all you have to do."</p>

<p>The steward bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>But before his letter arrived to Sandford, Sandford arrived
in town; and Mr. Giffard related, word for word, what had
passed between him and his Lord. Upon every occasion, and
upon every topic, except that of Lady Elmwood and her
child, Sandford was just as free with Lord Elmwood as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
had ever been; and as usual (after his interview with the
steward) went into his apartment without any previous
notice. Lord Elmwood shook him by the hand, as upon all
other meetings; and yet, whether his fear suggested it or
not, Sandford thought he appeared more cool and reserved
with him than formerly.</p>

<p>During the whole day, the slightest mention of Lady
Elmwood, or of her child, was cautiously avoided&mdash;and not till
the evening, (after Sandford had risen to retire, and had
wished Lord Elmwood good night) did he dare to mention
the subject. He then, after taking leave, and going to the
door&mdash;turned back and said, "My Lord,"&mdash;</p>

<p>It was easy to guess on what he was preparing to speak&mdash;his
voice failed, the tears began to trickle down his cheeks,
he took out his handkerchief, and could proceed no farther.</p>

<p>"I thought," said Lord Elmwood, angrily, "I thought
I had given my orders upon the subject&mdash;did not my steward
write them to you?"</p>

<p>"He did, my Lord," said Sandford, humbly, "but I was
set out before they arrived."</p>

<p>"Has he not <i>told</i> you my mind then?" cried he, more
angrily still.</p>

<p>"He has;" replied Sandford,&mdash;"But"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what, Sir?" cried Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"Your Lordship," continued Sandford, "was mistaken in
supposing that Lady Elmwood left a will, she left none."</p>

<p>"No will? no will at all?" returned he, surprised.</p>

<p>"No, my Lord," answered Sandford, "she wished every
thing to be as you willed."</p>

<p>"She left me all the trouble, then, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No great trouble, Sir; for there are but two persons
whom she has left behind her, to hope for your protection."</p>

<p>"And who are those two?" cried he hastily.</p>

<p>"One, my Lord, I need not name&mdash;the other is Miss
Woodley."</p>

<p>There was a delicacy and humility in the manner in which
Sandford delivered this reply, that Lord Elmwood could <i>not</i>
resent, and he only returned,</p>

<p>"Miss Woodley&mdash;is she yet living?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is&mdash;I left her at the house I came from."</p>

<p>"Well then," answered he, "you must see that my
steward provides for those two persons. That care I leave
to you&mdash;and should there be any complaints, on you they
fall."</p>

<p>Sandford bowed and was going.</p>

<p>"And now," resumed Lord Elmwood, in a more stern
voice, "let me never hear again on this subject. You have
power to act in regard to the persons you have mentioned;
and upon you their situation, the care, the whole management
of them depends&mdash;but be sure you never let them be
named before me, from this moment."</p>

<p>"Then," said Sandford, "as this must be the last time
they are mentioned, I must now take the opportunity to
disburden my mind of a charge"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What charge?" cried Lord Elmwood, morosely interrupting
him.</p>

<p>"Though Lady Elmwood, my Lord, left no will behind
her, she left a request."</p>

<p>"A request!" said he, starting, "If it is for me to see
her daughter, I tell you now before you ask, that I will not
grant it&mdash;for by heaven (and he spoke and looked most
solemnly) though I have no resentment against the innocent
child, and wish her happy, yet I will never see her. Never,
for her mother's sake, suffer my heart again to be softened
by an object I might dote upon. Therefore, Sir, if that is
the request, it is already answered; my will is fixed."</p>

<p>"The request, my Lord," replied Sandford, (and he took
out a pocket-book from whence he drew several papers)
"is contained in this letter; nor do I rightly know what its
contents are." And he held it out to him.</p>

<p>"Is it Lady Elmwood's writing?" asked Lord Elmwood,
extremely discomposed.</p>

<p>"It is, my Lord.&mdash;She wrote it a few days before she died,
and enjoined me to deliver it to you, with my own hands."</p>

<p>"I refuse to read it:" cried he, putting it from him&mdash;and
trembling while he did so.</p>

<p>"She desired me," said Sandford, (still presenting the
letter) "to conjure you to read it, <i>for her father's sake</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Elmwood took it instantly. But as soon as it was in his
hand, he seemed distressed to know what he should do with
it&mdash;in what place to go and read it&mdash;or how to fortify himself
against its contents. He appeared ashamed too, that he had
been so far prevailed upon, and said, by way of excuse,</p>

<p>"For Mr. Milner's sake I would do much&mdash;nay, any
thing, but that to which I have just now sworn never to
consent. For his sake I have borne a great deal&mdash;for his
sake alone, his daughter died my wife. You know, no other
motive than respect for him, prevented my divorcing her.
Pray (and he hesitated) was she buried with him?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord&mdash;she expressed no such desire; and as
that was the case, I did not think it necessary to carry the
corpse so far."</p>

<p>At the word corpse, Lord Elmwood shrunk, and looked
shocked beyond measure&mdash;but recovering himself, said,
"I am sorry for it; for he loved <i>her</i> sincerely, if she did not
love him&mdash;and I wish they had been buried together."</p>

<p>"It is not then too late," said Sandford, and was going
on&mdash;but the other interrupted him.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;we will have no disturbing the dead."</p>

<p>"Read her letter then," said Sandford, "and bid her rest
in peace."</p>

<p>"If it is in my power," returned he, "to grant what she
asks, I will&mdash;but if her demand is what I apprehend, I cannot,
I will not, bid her rest by complying. You know my resolution,
my disposition, and take care how you provoke me.
You may do an injury to the very person you are seeking to
befriend&mdash;the very maintenance I mean to allow her daughter
I can withdraw."</p>

<p>Poor Sandford, all alarmed at this menace, replied with
energy, "My Lord, unless you begin the subject, I never
shall presume to mention it again."</p>

<p>"I take you at your word, and in consequence of that,
but of that alone, we are friends. Good night, Sir."</p>

<p>Sandford bowed with humility, and they went to their
separate bedchambers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>After Lord Elmwood had retired into his chamber, it
was some time before he read the letter Sandford had given
him. He first walked backwards and forwards in the room&mdash;he
then began to take off some part of his dress, but he did
it slowly. At length, he dismissed his valet, and sitting down,
took the letter from his pocket. He looked at the seal, but
not at the direction; for he seemed to dread seeing Lady
Elmwood's handwriting. He then laid it on the table, and
began again to undress. He did not proceed, but taking up
the letter quickly, (with a kind of effort in making the
resolution) broke it open. These were its contents:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My Lord,</p>

<p>"Who writes this letter I well know&mdash;I well know also to
whom it is addressed&mdash;I feel with the most powerful force
both our situations; nor should I dare to offer you even this
humble petition, but that at the time you receive it, there
will be no such person as I am, in existence.</p>

<p>"For myself, then, all concern will be over&mdash;but there is
a care that pursues me to the grave, and threatens my want of
repose even there.</p>

<p>"I leave a child&mdash;I will not call her mine: that has undone
her&mdash;I will not call her yours; that will be of no avail&mdash;I
present her before you as the granddaughter of Mr. Milner.
Oh! do not refuse an asylum even in your own house, to the
destitute offspring of your friend; the last, and only remaining
branch of his family.</p>

<p>"Receive her into your household, be her condition there
ever so abject. I cannot write distinctly what I would&mdash;my
senses are not impaired, but the powers of expression are.
The complaint of the unfortunate child in the scriptures
(a lesson I have studied) has made this wish cling so fast to
my heart, that without the distant hope of its being fulfilled,
death would have more terrors than my weak mind could
support.</p>

<p>"'<i>I will go to my father; how many servants live in my
father's house, and are fed with plenty, while I starve in a
foreign land?</i>'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not ask a parent's festive rejoicing at her approach&mdash;I
do not even ask her father to behold her; but let her live
under his protection. For her grandfather's sake do not
refuse this&mdash;to the child of his child, whom he entrusted to
your care, do not refuse it.</p>

<p>"Be her host; I remit the tie of being her parent. Never
see her&mdash;but let her sometimes live under the same roof
with you.</p>

<p>"It is Miss Milner, your ward, to whom you never refused
a request, who supplicates you&mdash;not now for your nephew,
Rushbrook, but for one so much more dear, that a denial&mdash;&mdash;she
dares not suffer her thoughts to glance that way.&mdash;She
will hope&mdash;and in that hope, bids you farewell, with all the
love she ever bore you.</p>

<p>"Farewell Dorriforth&mdash;farewell Lord Elmwood&mdash;and
before you throw this letter from you with contempt or
anger, cast your imagination into the grave where I am
lying. Reflect upon all the days of my past life&mdash;the anxious
moments I have known, and what has been their end.
Behold <i>me</i>, also&mdash;in my altered face there is no anxiety&mdash;no
joy or sorrow&mdash;all is over.&mdash;&mdash;My whole frame is motionless&mdash;my
heart beats no more. Look at my horrid habitation,
too,&mdash;and ask yourself&mdash;whether I am an object of resentment?"</p></div>

<p>While Lord Elmwood read this letter, it trembled in his
hand: he once or twice wiped the tears from his eyes as he
read, and once laid the letter down for a few minutes. At
its conclusion, the tears flowed fast down his face; but he
seemed both ashamed and angry they did, and was going
to throw the paper upon the fire&mdash;he however suddenly
checked his hand, and putting it hastily into his pocket, went
to bed.</p>

<h2><a name="III_CHAPTER_V" id="III_CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The next morning, when Lord Elmwood and Sandford
met at breakfast, the latter was pale with fear for the success
of Lady Elmwood's letter&mdash;the Earl was pale too, but there
was besides upon his face, something which evidently marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
he was displeased. Sandford observed it, and was all humbleness,
both in his words and looks, in order to soften him.</p>

<p>As soon as the breakfast was removed, Lord Elmwood
drew the letter from his pocket, and holding it towards
Sandford, said,</p>

<p>"That, may be of more value to you, than it is to me,
therefore I give it you."</p>

<p>Sandford called up a look of surprise, as if he did not know
the letter again.</p>

<p>"'Tis Lady Elmwood's letter," said Lord Elmwood, "and
I return it to you for two reasons."</p>

<p>Sandford took it, and putting it up, asked fearfully, "What
those two reasons were?"</p>

<p>"First," said he, "because I think it is a relick you may like
to preserve&mdash;my second reason is, that you may shew it to
her daughter, and let her know why, and on what conditions,
I grant her mother's request."</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> then grant it?" cried Sandford joyfully;
"I thank you&mdash;you are kind&mdash;you are considerate."</p>

<p>"Be not hasty in your gratitude; you may have cause to
recall it."</p>

<p>"I know what you have said;" replied Sandford, "you
have said you grant Lady Elmwood's request&mdash;you cannot
recall these words, nor I my gratitude."</p>

<p>"Do you know what her request is?" returned he.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, my Lord&mdash;I told you before, I did not; but
it is no doubt something in favour of her child."</p>

<p>"I think not," he replied: "such as it is, however, I grant
it: but in the strictest sense of the word&mdash;no farther&mdash;and
one neglect of my commands, releases me from this
promise totally."</p>

<p>"We will take care, Sir, not to disobey them."</p>

<p>"Then listen to what they are, for to you I give the charge
of delivering them again. Lady Elmwood has petitioned me
in the name of her father, (a name I reverence) to give his
grandchild the sanction of my protection. In the literal
sense, to suffer that she may reside at one of my seats; dispensing
at the same time with my ever seeing her."</p>

<p>"And you will comply?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, till she encroaches on this concession, and dares to
hope for a greater. I will, while she avoids my sight, or the
giving me any remembrance of her. But if, whether by
design or by accident, I ever see or hear from her, that
moment, my compliance to her mother's supplication ceases,
and I abandon her once more."</p>

<p>Sandford sighed. Lord Elmwood continued:</p>

<p>"I am glad her request stopped where it did. I would
rather comply with her desires than not; and I rejoice they
are such as I can grant with ease and honour to myself.
I am seldom now at Elmwood castle; let her daughter go
there; the few weeks or months I am down in the summer,
she may easily in that extensive house avoid me&mdash;while she
does, she lives in security&mdash;when she does not&mdash;you know my
resolution."</p>

<p>Sandford bowed&mdash;the Earl resumed:</p>

<p>"Nor can it be a hardship to obey this command&mdash;she
cannot lament the separation from a parent whom she never
knew&mdash;" Sandford was going eagerly to prove the error of
that assertion, but he prevented him, saying, "In a word&mdash;without
farther argument&mdash;if she obeys me in this, I will
provide for her as my daughter during my life, and leave
her a fortune at my death&mdash;but if she dares&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sandford interrupted the menace prepared for utterance,
saying, "and you still mean, I suppose, to make Mr. Rushbrook
your heir?"</p>

<p>"Have you not heard me say so? And do you imagine
I have changed my determination? I am not given to alter
my resolutions, Mr. Sandford; and I thought you knew
I was not; besides, will not my title be extinct, whoever
I make my heir? Could any thing but a son have preserved
my title?"</p>

<p>"Then it is yet possible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By marrying again, you mean? No&mdash;no&mdash;I have had
enough of marriage&mdash;and Henry Rushbrook I shall leave my
heir. Therefore, Sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My Lord, I do not presume&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not, Sandford, and we may still be good friends.
But I am not to be controlled as formerly; my temper is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
changed of late; changed to what it was originally; till
your religious precepts reformed it. You may remember,
how troublesome it was, to conquer my stubborn disposition
in my youth; <i>then</i>, indeed, you <i>did</i>; but in my more
advanced age, you will find the task too difficult."</p>

<p>Sandford again repeated, "He should not presume&mdash;"</p>

<p>To which Lord Elmwood again made answer, "Do not,
Sandford;" and added, "for I have a sincere regard for
you, and should be loath, at these years, to quarrel with
you seriously."</p>

<p>Sandford turned away his head to conceal his feelings.</p>

<p>"Nay, if we do quarrel," resumed Lord Elmwood, "You
know it must be your own fault; and as this is a theme the
most likely of any, nay, the only one on which we can have
a difference (such as we cannot forgive) take care never from
this day to resume it; indeed that of itself, would be an
offence I could not pardon. I have been clear and explicit in
all I have said; there can be no fear of mistaking my meaning;
therefore, all future explanation is unnecessary&mdash;nor will
I permit a word, or a hint on the subject from any one,
without shewing my resentment even to the hour of my
death." He was going out of the room.</p>

<p>"But before we bid adieu to the subject for ever, my Lord&mdash;there
was another person whom I named to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Miss Woodley? Oh, by all means let her
live at Elmwood House too. On consideration, I have no
objection to see Miss Woodley at any time&mdash;I shall be glad
to see her&mdash;do not let <i>her</i> be frightened at me&mdash;to her I shall
be the same, that I have always been."</p>

<p>"She is a good woman, my Lord," cried Sandford, pleased.</p>

<p>"You need not tell me that, Mr. Sandford; I know her
worth." And he left the room.</p>

<p>Sandford, to relieve Miss Woodley and her lovely charge
from the suspence in which he had left them, prepared to set
off for their habitation, in order himself to conduct them
from thence to Elmwood Castle, and appoint some retired
part of it for Lady Matilda, against the annual visit her
father should pay there. But before he left London, Giffard,
the steward, took an opportunity to wait upon him, and let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
him know, that his Lord had acquainted him with the consent
he had given for his daughter to be admitted at Elmwood
Castle, and upon what restrictions: that he had farther
uttered the severest threats, should these restrictions ever be
infringed. Sandford thanked Giffard for his friendly information.
It served him as a second warning of the circumspection
that was necessary; and having taken leave of his
friend and patron, under the pretence that "He could not
live in the smoke of London," he set out for the North.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say with what delight Sandford was
received by Miss Woodley, and the hapless daughter of Lady
Elmwood, even before he told his errand. They both loved
him sincerely; more especially Lady Matilda, whose forlorn
state, and innocent sufferings, had ever excited his compassion
and caused him to treat her with affection, tenderness, and
respect. She knew, too, how much he had been her mother's
friend; for that, she also loved him; and for being honoured
with the friendship of her father, she looked up to him with
reverence. For Matilda (with an excellent understanding,
a sedateness above her years, and early accustomed to the
most private converse between Lady Elmwood and Miss
Woodley) was perfectly acquainted with the whole fatal
history of her mother; and was, by her, taught the respect
and admiration of her father's virtues which they justly
merited.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the joy of Mr. Sandford's presence, once
more to cheer their solitary dwelling; no sooner were the
first kind greetings over, than the dread of what he might
have to inform them of, possessed poor Matilda and Miss
Woodley so powerfully, that all their gladness was changed
into affright. Their apprehensions were far more forcible
than their curiosity; they dared not ask a question, and
even began to wish he would continue silent upon the subject
on which they feared to listen. For near two hours he was
so.&mdash;&mdash;At length, after a short interval from speaking,
(during which they waited with anxiety for what he might
next say) he turned to Lady Matilda, and said,</p>

<p>"You don't ask for your father, my dear."</p>

<p>"I did not know it was proper:" she replied, timidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is always proper," answered Sandford, "for <i>you</i> to
think of him, though he should never think on you."</p>

<p>She burst into tears, and said that she "<i>Did</i> think of him,
but she felt an apprehension of mentioning his name"&mdash;and
she wept bitterly while she spoke.</p>

<p>"Do not think I reproved you," said Sandford; "I only
told you what was right."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Miss Woodley, "she does not weep for that&mdash;she
fears her father has not complied with her mother's
request. Perhaps&mdash;not even read her letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he <i>has</i> read it," returned Sandford.</p>

<p>"Oh Heavens!" exclaimed Matilda, clasping her hands
together, and the tears falling still faster.</p>

<p>"Do not be so much alarmed, my dear," said Miss Woodley;
"you know we are prepared for the worst; and you
know you promised your mother, whatever your fate should
be, to submit with patience."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matilda, "and I am prepared for every
thing, but my father's refusal to my dear mother."</p>

<p>"Your father has not refused your mother's request,"
replied Sandford.</p>

<p>She was leaping from her seat in ecstasy.</p>

<p>"But," continued he, "do you know what her request
was?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely," replied Matilda, "and since it is granted,
I am careless. But she told me her letter concerned none
but me."</p>

<p>To explain perfectly to Matilda, Lady Elmwood's letter,
and that she might perfectly understand upon what terms
she was admitted into Elmwood Castle, Sandford now read
the letter to her; and repeated, as nearly as he could remember,
the whole of the conversation that passed between Lord
Elmwood and himself; not even sparing, through an
erroneous delicacy, any of those threats her father had
denounced, should she dare to transgress the limits he
prescribed&mdash;nor did he try to soften, in one instance, a word
he uttered. She listened sometimes with tears, sometimes
with hope, but always with awe, and with terror, to every
sentence in which her father was concerned. Once she called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
him cruel&mdash;then exclaimed "He was kind;" but at the end
of Sandford's intelligence, concluded "that she was happy
and grateful for the boon bestowed." Even her mother
had not a more exalted idea of Lord Elmwood's worth than
his daughter had formed; and this little bounty just obtained,
would not have been greater in her mother's estimation,
than it was now in hers. Miss Woodley, too, smiled
at the prospect before her&mdash;she esteemed Lord Elmwood
beyond any mortal living&mdash;she was proud to hear what he
had said in her praise, and overjoyed at the prospect of being
once again in his company; painting at the same time
a thousand bright hopes, from watching every emotion of his
soul, and catching every proper occasion to excite or increase
his paternal sentiments. Yet she had the prudence to conceal
those vague hopes from his child, lest a disappointment might
prove fatal; and assuming a behaviour neither too much
elated or depressed, she advised that they should hope for
the best, but yet, as usual, expect and prepare for the worst.&mdash;&mdash;After
taking measures for quitting their melancholy
abode, within the fortnight, they all departed for Elmwood
Castle&mdash;Matilda, Miss Woodley, and even Sandford, first
visiting Lady Elmwood's grave, and bedewing it with their
tears.</p>

<h2><a name="III_CHAPTER_VI" id="III_CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>It was on a dark evening in the month of March, that
Lady Matilda, accompanied by Sandford and Miss Woodley,
arrived at Elmwood Castle, the magnificent seat of her
father. Sandford chose the evening, rather to steal into
the house privately, than by any appearance of parade, to
suffer Lord Elmwood to be reminded of their arrival by the
public prints, or by any other accident. Nor would he give
the neighbours or servants reason to suppose, the daughter
of their Lord was admitted into his house, in any other
situation than that, in which she really was permitted to be
there.</p>

<p>As the porter opened the gates of the avenue to the carriage
that brought them, Matilda felt an awful, and yet gladsome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
sensation, which no terms can describe. As she entered the
door of the house this sensation increased&mdash;and as she passed
along the spacious hall, the splendid staircase, and many
stately apartments, wonder, with a crowd of the tenderest,
yet most afflicting sentiments, rushed to her heart. She
gazed with astonishment!&mdash;she reflected with still more.</p>

<p>"And is <i>my father</i> the master of this house?" she cried&mdash;"and
was my mother once the mistress of this castle?" Here
tears relieved her from a part of that burthen, which was
before insupportable.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sandford, "and you are the mistress of it
now, till your father arrives."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed she, "and will he ever arrive?
and shall I live to sleep under the same roof with my father?"</p>

<p>"My dear," replied Miss Woodley, "have not you been
told so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "but though I heard it with extreme
pleasure, yet the idea never so forcibly affected me as at this
moment. I now feel, as the reality approaches, that to be
admitted here, is kindness enough&mdash;I do not ask for more&mdash;I
am now convinced, from what this trial makes me feel, that
to see my father, would occasion emotions I could not
survive."</p>

<p>The next morning gave to Matilda, more objects of
admiration and wonder, as she walked over the extensive
gardens, groves, and other pleasure grounds belonging to
the house. She, who had never been beyond the dreary,
ruinous places which her deceased mother had made her
residence, was naturally struck with amazement and delight
at the grandeur of a seat, which travellers came for miles to
see, nor thought their time mispent.</p>

<p>There was one object, however, among all she saw, which
attracted her attention above the rest, and she would stand
for hours to look at it. This was a whole length portrait of
Lord Elmwood, esteemed a very capital picture, and a perfect
likeness&mdash;to this picture she would sigh and weep; though
when it was first pointed out to her, she shrunk back with fear,
and it was some time before she dared venture to cast her
eyes completely upon it. In the features of her father she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
was proud to discern the exact mould in which her own
appeared to have been modelled; yet Matilda's person,
shape, and complexion were so extremely like what her
mother's once were, that at the first glance she appeared to
have a still greater resemblance of her, than of her father&mdash;but
her mind and manners were all Lord Elmwood's;
softened by the delicacy of her sex, the extreme tenderness
of her heart, and the melancholy of her situation.</p>

<p>She was now in her seventeenth year&mdash;of the same age,
within a year and a few months, of her mother, when she
became the ward of Dorriforth. She was just three years old
when her father went abroad, and remembered something
of bidding him farewell; but more of taking cherries from
his hand, as he pulled them from the tree to give to her.</p>

<p>Educated in the school of adversity, and inured to retirement
from her infancy, she had acquired a taste for all those
amusements which a recluse life affords. She was fond of
walking and riding&mdash;was accomplished in the arts of music
and drawing, by the most careful instructions of her mother&mdash;and
as a scholar, she excelled most of her sex, from the
pains which Sandford had taken with that part of her education,
and the superior abilities he possessed for the task.</p>

<p>In devoting certain hours of the day to study with him,
others to music, riding, and such amusements, Matilda's
time never appeared tedious at Elmwood Castle, although
she received and paid no one visit&mdash;for it was soon divulged
in the neighbourhood, upon what stipulation she resided at
her father's, and studiously intimated, that the most prudent
and friendly behaviour of her true friends, would be, to take
no notice whatever that she lived among them: and as Lord
Elmwood's will was a law all around, such was the consequence
of that will, known, or merely supposed.</p>

<p>Neither did Miss Woodley regret the want of visitors, but
found herself far more satisfied in her present situation, than
her most sanguine hopes could have formed. She had
a companion whom she loved with an equal fondness, with
which she had loved her deceased mother; and frequently,
in this charming mansion, where she had so often beheld
Lady Elmwood, her imagination represented Matilda as her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
friend risen from the grave, in her former youth, health, and
exquisite beauty.</p>

<p>In peace, in content, though not in happiness, the days
and weeks passed away till about the middle of August, when
preparations began to be made for the arrival of Lord
Elmwood. The week in which he was to come was at length
fixed, and some part of his retinue was arrived before him.
When this was told Matilda, she started, and looked just as
her mother at her age had often done, when in spite of her
love, she was conscious that she had offended him, and was
terrified at his approach. Sandford observing this, put out
his hand, and taking hers, shook it kindly; and bade her
(but it was not in a cheering tone) "not be afraid." This
gave her no confidence; and she began, before her father's
arrival, to seclude herself in the apartments allotted for her
during the time of his stay; and in the timorous expectation
of his coming, her appetite declined, and she lost all her
colour. Even Miss Woodley, whose spirits had been for some
time elated with the hopes she had formed, on drawing near
to the test, found those hopes vanished; and though she
endeavoured to conceal it, she was full of apprehensions.
Sandford, had certainly fewer fears than either; yet upon
the eve of the day on which his patron was to arrive, he was
evidently cast down.</p>

<p>Lady Matilda once asked him&mdash;"Are you certain, Mr.
Sandford, you made no mistake in respect to what Lord
Elmwood said, when he granted my mother's request? Are
you sure he <i>did</i> grant it? Was there nothing equivocal on
which he may ground his displeasure should he be told that
I am here? Oh do not let me hazard being once again
turned out of his house! Oh! save me from provoking him
perhaps to curse me." And here she clasped her hands
together with the most fervent petition, in the dread of
what might happen.</p>

<p>"If you doubt my words or my senses," said Sandford,
"call Giffard, and let him inform you; the same words were
repeated to him as to me."</p>

<p>Though from her reason, Matilda could not doubt of any
mistake from Mr. Sandford, yet her fears suggested a thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
scruples; and this reference to the steward she received
with the utmost satisfaction, (though she did not think it
necessary to apply to him) as it perfectly convinced her of
the folly of the suspicions she had entertained.</p>

<p>"And yet, Mr. Sandford," said she, "if it is so, why are
you less cheerful than you were? I cannot help thinking but
it must be your expectation of Lord Elmwood, which has
occasioned this change."</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Sandford, carelessly, "but I
believe I am grown afraid of your father. His temper is
a great deal altered from what it once was&mdash;he raises his
voice, and uses harsh expressions upon the least provocation&mdash;his
eyes flash lightning, and his face is distorted with anger
upon the slightest motives&mdash;he turns away his old servants
at a moment's warning, and no concession can make their
peace. In a word, I am more at my ease when I am away
from him&mdash;and I really believe," added he with a smile, but
with a tear at the same time, "I really believe, I am more
afraid of <i>him</i> in my age, than he was of <i>me</i> when he was a boy."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley was present; she and Matilda looked at one
another; and each of them saw the other turn pale at this
description.</p>

<p>The day at length came, on which Lord Elmwood was
expected to dinner. It would have been a high gratification
to his daughter to have gone to the topmost window of the
house, and have only beheld his carriage enter the avenue;
but it was a gratification which her fears, her tremor, her
extreme sensibility would not permit her to enjoy.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley and she, sat down that day to dinner in
their retired apartments, which were detached from the
other part of the house by a gallery; and of the door leading
to the gallery, they had a key to impede any one from passing
that way, without first ringing a bell; to answer which, was
the sole employment of a servant, who was placed there
during the Earl's residence, lest by any accident he might
chance to come near that unfrequented part of the house,
on which occasion the man was to give immediate notice to
his Lady.</p>

<p>Matilda and Miss Woodley sat down to dinner, but did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
dine. Sandford dined as usual, with Lord Elmwood. When
tea was brought, Miss Woodley asked the servant, who
attended, if he had seen his Lord. The man answered,
"Yes, Madam; and he looks vastly well." Matilda wept
with joy to hear it.</p>

<p>About nine in the evening, Sandford rang at the bell, and
was admitted&mdash;never had he been so welcome&mdash;Matilda
hung upon him, as if his recent interview with her father,
had endeared him to her more than ever; and staring
anxiously in his face, seemed to enquire of him something
about Lord Elmwood, and something that should not alarm
her.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;how do you find yourself?" said he to her.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Sandford?" she returned, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh! very well," replied he.</p>

<p>"Is my Lord in a good temper?" asked Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Yes; very well," replied Sandford, with indifference.</p>

<p>"Did he seem glad to see you?" asked Matilda.</p>

<p>"He shook me by the hand," replied Sandford.</p>

<p>"That was a sign he was glad to see you, was it not?"
said Matilda.</p>

<p>"Yes; but he could not do less."</p>

<p>"Nor more:" replied she.</p>

<p>"He looks very well, our servant tells us," said Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>"Extremely well indeed," answered Sandford: "and to
tell the truth, I never saw him in better spirits."</p>

<p>"That is well&mdash;" said Matilda, and sighed a weight of
fears from her heart.</p>

<p>"Where is he now, Mr. Sandford?"</p>

<p>"Gone to take a walk about his grounds, and I stole here
in the mean time."</p>

<p>"What was your conversation during dinner?" asked
Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Horses, hay, farming, and politics."</p>

<p>"Won't you sup with him?"</p>

<p>"I shall see him again before I go to bed."</p>

<p>"And again to-morrow!" cried Matilda, "what happiness!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has visitors to-morrow," said Sandford, "coming
for a week or two."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven," said Miss Woodley, "he will then be
diverted from thinking on us."</p>

<p>"Do you know," returned Sandford, "it is my firm
opinion, that his thinking of ye at present, is the cause of his
good spirits."</p>

<p>"Oh, Heavens!" cried Matilda, lifting up her hands with
rapture.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not mistake me," said Sandford; "I would
not have you build a foundation for joy upon this surmise;
for if he is in spirits that you are in this house&mdash;so near him&mdash;positively
under his protection&mdash;yet he will not allow himself
to think it is the cause of his content&mdash;and the sentiments he
has adopted, and which are now become natural to him, will
remain the same as ever; nay, perhaps with greater force,
should he suspect his weakness (as he calls it) acting in opposition
to them."</p>

<p>"If he does but think of me with tenderness," cried
Matilda, "I am recompensed."</p>

<p>"And what recompense would his kind thoughts be to
you," said Sandford, "were he to turn you out to beggary?"</p>

<p>"A great deal&mdash;a great deal," she replied.</p>

<p>"But how are you to know he has these kind thoughts,
if he gives you no proof of them?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Sandford; but <i>supposing</i> we could know them
without proof."</p>

<p>"But as that is impossible," answered he, "I shall suppose,
till proof appears, that I have been mistaken in my conjectures."</p>

<p>Matilda looked deeply concerned that the argument should
conclude in her disappointment; for to have believed herself
thought of with tenderness by her father, would have alone
constituted her happiness.</p>

<p>When the servant came up with something by way of
supper, he told Mr. Sandford that his Lord was returned
from his walk and had enquired for him; Sandford immediately
bade his companions good night, and left them.</p>

<p>"How strange is this!" cried Matilda, when Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Woodley and she were alone, "My father within a few rooms
of me, and yet I am debarred from seeing him! Only by
walking a few paces I could be at his feet, and perhaps receive
his blessing!"</p>

<p>"You make me shudder," cried Miss Woodley; "but
some spirits less timid than mine, might perhaps advise you
to the experiment."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds!" returned Matilda, "no counsel could
tempt me to such temerity&mdash;and yet to entertain the thought
that it is possible I could do this, is a source of infinite
comfort."</p>

<p>This conversation lasted till bed time, and later; for they
sat up beyond their usual hour to indulge it.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley slept little, but Matilda less&mdash;she awaked
repeatedly during the night, and every time sighed to herself,
"I sleep in the same house with my father! Blessed spirit
of my mother, look down and rejoice."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The next day the whole Castle appeared to Lady Matilda
(though she was in some degree retired from it) all tumult
and bustle, as was usually the case while Lord Elmwood was
there. She saw from her windows, the servants running
across the yards and park; horses and carriages driving with
fury; all the suite of a nobleman; and it sometimes elated,
at other times depressed her.</p>

<p>These impressions however, and others of fear and anxiety,
which her father's arrival had excited, by degrees wore off;
and after some little time, she was in the same tranquil state
that she enjoyed before he came.</p>

<p>He had visitors, who passed a week or two with him; he
paid visits himself for several days; and thus the time stole
away, till it was about four weeks from the time that he had
arrived; in which long period, Sandford, with all his penetration,
could never clearly discover whether he had once
called to mind that his daughter was living in the same house.
He had not once named her (that was not extraordinary)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
consequently no one dared name her to him; but he had not
even mentioned Miss Woodley, of whom he had so lately
spoken in the kindest terms, and had said, "He should take
pleasure in seeing her again." From these contradictions in
Lord Elmwood's behaviour in respect to her, it was Miss
Woodley's plan neither to throw herself in his way, nor avoid
him. She therefore frequently walked about the house while
he was in it, not indeed entirely without restraint, but at
least with the show of liberty. This freedom, indulged for
some time without peril, became at last less cautious; and
as no ill consequences had arisen from its practice, her
scruples gradually ceased.</p>

<p>One morning, however, as she was crossing the large hall,
thoughtless of danger, a footstep at a distance alarmed her
almost without knowing why. She stopped for a moment,
thinking to return; the steps approached quicker, and before
she could retreat, she beheld Lord Elmwood at the other end
of the hall, and perceived that he saw her. It was too late
to hesitate what was to be done; she could not go back,
and had not courage to go on; she therefore stood still.
Disconcerted, and much affected at his sight, (their former
intimacy coming to her mind with the many years, and many
sad occurrences passed, since she last saw him) all her intentions,
all her meditated plans how to conduct herself on
such an occasion, gave way to a sudden shock&mdash;and to make
the meeting yet more distressing, her very fright, she knew,
would serve to recall more powerfully to his mind, the
subject she most wished him to forget. The steward was
with him, and as they came up close by her side, Giffard
observing him look at her earnestly, said softly, but so as she
heard him, "My Lord, it is Miss Woodley." Lord Elmwood
took off his hat instantly&mdash;and, with an apparent friendly
warmth, laying hold of her hand, he said, "Indeed, Miss
Woodley, I did not know you&mdash;I am very glad to see you:"
and while he spoke, shook her hand with a cordiality which
her tender heart could not bear&mdash;and never did she feel so
hard a struggle as to restrain her tears. But the thought of
Matilda's fate&mdash;the idea of awakening in his mind a sentiment
that might irritate him against his child, wrought more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
forcibly than every other effort; and though she could not
reply distinctly, she replied without weeping. Whether he
saw her embarrassment, and wished to release her from it,
or was in haste to conceal his own, he left her almost instantly:
but not till he had entreated she would dine that very day
with him and Mr. Sandford, who were to dine without other
company. She curtsied assent, and flew to tell Matilda what
had occurred. After listening with anxiety and with joy
to all she told, Matilda laid hold of that hand which she said
Lord Elmwood had held, and pressed it to her lips with love
and reverence.</p>

<p>When Miss Woodley made her appearance at dinner,
Sandford, (who had not seen her since the invitation, and
did not know of it) looked amazed; on which Lord Elmwood
said, "Do you know, Sandford, I met Miss Woodley this
morning, and had it not been for Giffard, I should have
passed her without knowing her&mdash;but Miss Woodley, if I am
not so much altered but that you knew me, I take it unkind
you did not speak first." She was unable to speak even now&mdash;he
saw it, and changed the conversation; when Sandford
eagerly joined in discourse, which relieved him from the pain
of the former.</p>

<p>As they advanced in their dinner, the embarrassment of
Miss Woodley and of Mr. Sandford diminished; Lord
Elmwood in his turn became, not embarrassed, but absent
and melancholy. He now and then sighed heavily&mdash;and called
for wine much oftener than he was accustomed.</p>

<p>When Miss Woodley took her leave, he invited her to dine
with him and Sandford whenever it was convenient to her;
he said, besides, many things of the same kind, and all with
the utmost civility, yet not with that warmth with which he
had spoken in the morning&mdash;into <i>that</i> he had been surprised&mdash;his
coolness was the effect of reflection.</p>

<p>When she came to Lady Matilda, and Sandford had
joined them, they talked and deliberated on what had passed.</p>

<p>"You acknowledge Mr. Sandford," said Miss Woodley,
"that you think my presence affected Lord Elmwood, so as
to make him much more thoughtful than usual; if you
imagine these thoughts were upon Lady Elmwood, I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
never intrude again; but if you suppose that I made him
think upon his daughter, I cannot go too often."</p>

<p>"I don't see how he can divide those two objects in his
mind," replied Sandford, "therefore you must e'en visit him
on, and take your chance, what reflections you may cause&mdash;but,
be they what they will, time will steal away from you
that power of affecting him."</p>

<p>She concurred in the opinion, and occasionally she walked
into Lord Elmwood's apartments, dined, or took her coffee
with him, as the accident suited; and observed, according
to Sandford's prediction, that time wore off the impression
her visits first made. Lord Elmwood now became just the
same before her as before others. She easily discerned, too,
through all that politeness which he assumed&mdash;that he was
no longer the considerate, the forbearing character he
formerly was; but haughty, impatient, imperious, and more
than ever, <i>implacable</i>.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When Lord Elmwood had been at his country seat about
six weeks, Mr. Rushbrook, his nephew, and his adopted
child&mdash;that friendless boy whom poor Lady Elmwood first
introduced into his uncle's house, and by her kindness preserved
there&mdash;arrived from his travels, and was received by
his uncle with all the marks of affection due to the man he
thought worthy to be his heir. Rushbrook had been a
beautiful boy, and was now an extremely handsome young
man; he had made unusual progress in his studies, had
completed the tour of Italy and Germany, and returned
home with the air and address of a perfect man of fashion&mdash;there
was, besides, an elegance and persuasion in his manner
almost irresistible. Yet with all those accomplishments,
when he was introduced to Sandford, and put forth his hand
to take his, Sandford, with evident reluctance, gave it to him;
and when Lord Elmwood asked him, in the young man's
presence, "If he did not think his nephew greatly improved?"
He looked at him from head to foot, and muttered "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
could not say he observed it." The colour heightened in
Mr. Rushbrook's face upon the occasion, but he was too well
bred not to be in perfect good humour.</p>

<p>Sandford saw this young man treated, in the house of
Lord Elmwood, with the same respect and attention as if he
had been his son; and it was but probable the old priest
would make a comparison between the situation of him, and
of Lady Matilda Elmwood. Before her, it was Sandford's
meaning to have concealed his thoughts upon the subject,
and never to have mentioned it but with composure; that
was, however, impossible&mdash;unused to hide his feelings, at the
name of Rushbrook, his countenance would always change,
and a sarcastic sneer, sometimes a frown of resentment, would
force its way in spite of his resolution. Miss Woodley, too,
with all her boundless charity and good will, was, upon this
occasion, induced to limit their excess; and they did not
extend so far as to reach poor Rushbrook. She even, and in
<i>reality</i>, did not think him handsome or engaging in his
manners&mdash;she thought his gaiety frivolousness, his complaisance
affectation, and his good humour impertinence.
It was impossible to conceal those unfavourable sentiments
entirely from Matilda; for when the subject arose, as it
frequently did, Miss Woodley's undisguised heart, and
Sandford's undisguised countenance, told them instantly.
Matilda had the understanding to imagine, that she was,
perhaps, the object who had thus deformed Mr. Rushbrook,
and frequently (though he was a stranger to her, and one who
had caused her many a jealous heart-ache) frequently she would
speak in his vindication.</p>

<p>"You are very good," said Sandford, one day to her;
"you like him, because you know your father loves him."</p>

<p>This was a hard sentence for the daughter of Lord Elmwood
to hear, to whom her father's love would have been more
precious than any other blessing.&mdash;She, however, checked
the assault of envy, and kindly replied,</p>

<p>"My mother loved him too, Mr. Sandford."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sandford, "he has been a <i>grateful</i> man
to your poor mother.&mdash;She did not suppose when she took
him into the house; when she intreated your father to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
him; and through her caresses and officious praises of him,
first gave him that power which he now possesses over his
uncle; she little foresaw, at that time, his ingratitude, and
its effects."</p>

<p>"Very true," said Miss Woodley, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"What ingratitude?" asked Matilda, "do you suppose
Mr. Rushbrook is the cause that my father will not see me?
Oh do not pay Lord Elmwood's motive so ill a compliment."</p>

<p>"I do not say that he is the absolute cause," returned
Sandford; "but if a parent's heart is void, I would have it
remain so, till its lawful owner is replaced&mdash;usurpers I
detest."</p>

<p>"No one can take Lord Elmwood's heart by force," replied
his daughter, "it must, I believe, be a free gift to the possessor;
and as such, whoever has it, has a right to it."</p>

<p>In this manner she would plead the young man's excuse&mdash;perhaps
but to hear what could be said in his disfavour,
for secretly his name was bitter to her&mdash;and once she
exclaimed in vexation, on Sandford's saying Lord Elmwood
and Mr. Rushbrook were gone out shooting together,</p>

<p>"All that pleasure is now eclipsed which I used to take in
listening to the report of my father's gun, for I cannot now
distinguish his, from his parasite's."</p>

<p>Sandford, (much as he disliked Rushbrook) for this expression
which comprised her father in the reflection, turned to
Matilda in extreme anger&mdash;but as he saw the colour mount
into her face, for what, in the strong feelings of her heart
had escaped her lips, he did not say a word&mdash;and by her tears
that followed, he rejoiced to see how much she reproved
<i>herself</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, vexed to the heart, and provoked every
time she saw Lord Elmwood and Rushbrook together, and
saw the familiar terms on which this young man lived with his
benefactor, now made her visits to him very seldom. If
Lord Elmwood observed this, he did not appear to observe it;
and though he received her politely when she did pay him
a visit, it was always very coldly; nor did she suppose if she
never went, he would ever ask for her. For his daughter's
sake, however, she thought it right sometimes to shew herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
before him; for she knew it must be impossible that, with
all his apparent indifference, he could ever see <i>her</i> without
thinking for a moment on his child; and what one fortunate
thought might some time bring about, was an object much
too serious for her to overlook. She therefore, after remaining
confined to her apartments near three weeks, (excepting
those anxious walks she and Matilda stole, while Lord
Elmwood dined, or before he rose in a morning) went one
forenoon into his apartments, where, as usual, she found him,
with Mr. Sandford, and Mr. Rushbrook. After she had
sat about half an hour, conversing with them all, though
but very little with the latter, Lord Elmwood was called
out of the room upon some business; presently after, Sandford;
and now, by no means pleased with the companion
with whom she was left, she rose, and was going likewise,
when Rushbrook fixed his speaking eyes upon her, and cried,</p>

<p>"Miss Woodley, will you pardon me what I am going
to say?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir. You can, I am sure, say nothing but
what I must forgive." But she made this reply with a distance
and a reserve, very unlike the usual manners of Miss
Woodley.</p>

<p>He looked at her earnestly and cried, "Ah! Miss Woodley,
you don't behave so kindly to me as you used to do!"</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Sir," she replied very gravely;
"Times are changed, Mr. Rushbrook, since you were last
here&mdash;you were then but a child."</p>

<p>"Yet I love all those persons now, that I loved then,"
replied he; "and so I shall for ever."</p>

<p>"But you mistake, Mr. Rushbrook; I was not even then
so very much the object of your affections&mdash;there were other
ladies you loved better. Perhaps you don't remember Lady
Elmwood?"</p>

<p>"Don't I," cried he, "Oh!" (clasping his hands and
lifting up his eyes to heaven) "shall I ever forget her?"</p>

<p>That moment Lord Elmwood opened the door; the conversation
of course that moment ended; but confusion, at
the sudden surprise, was on the face of both parties&mdash;he saw
it, and looked at each of them by turns, with a sternness that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
made poor Miss Woodley ready to faint; while Rushbrook,
with the most natural and happy laugh that ever was affected,
cried, "No, don't tell my Lord, pray Miss Woodley." She
was more confused than before, and Lord Elmwood turning
to him, asked what the subject was. By this time he had
invented one, and, continuing his laugh, said, "Miss Woodley,
my Lord, will to this day protest that she saw my
apparition when I was a boy; and she says it is a sign I shall
die young, and is really much affected at it."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood turned away before this ridiculous speech
was concluded; yet so well had it been acted, that he did
not for an instant doubt its truth.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley felt herself greatly relieved; and yet so little
is it in the power of those we dislike to do any thing to please
us, that from this very circumstance, she formed a more
unfavourable opinion of Mr. Rushbrook than she had done
before. She saw in this little incident the art of dissimulation,
cunning, and duplicity in its most glaring shape; and
detested the method by which they had each escaped Lord
Elmwood's suspicion, and perhaps anger, the more, because
it was so dexterously managed.</p>

<p>Lady Matilda and Sandford were both in their turns
informed of this trait in Mr. Rushbrook's character; and
although Miss Woodley had the best of dispositions, and
upon every occasion spoke the strictest truth, yet in relating
this occurrence, she did not speak <i>all</i> the truth; for every
circumstance that would have told to the young man's
advantage, <i>literally</i> had slipped her memory.</p>

<p>The twenty-ninth of October arrived; on which a dinner,
a ball, and supper, was given by Lord Elmwood to all the
neighbouring gentry&mdash;the peasants also dined in the park off
a roasted bullock, several casks of ale were distributed, and
the bells of the village rung. Matilda, who heard and saw
some part of this festivity from her windows, inquired the
cause; but even the servant who waited upon her had too
much sensibility to tell her, and answered, "He did not
know." Miss Woodley however, soon learned the reason,
and groaning with the painful secret, informed her, "Mr.
Rushbrook on that day was come of age."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>My</i> birth-day was last week," replied Matilda; but not
a word beside.</p>

<p>In their retired apartments, this day passed away not only
soberly, but almost silently; for to speak upon any subject
that did not engage their thoughts had been difficult, and to
speak upon the only one that did, had been afflicting.</p>

<p>Just as they were sitting down to dinner their bell gently
rung, and in walked Sandford.</p>

<p>"Why are you not among the revellers, Mr. Sandford?"
cried Miss Woodley, with an ironical sneer&mdash;(the first her
features ever wore)&mdash;"Pray, were not you invited to dine
with the company?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sandford; "but my head ached; and so
I had rather come and take a bit with you."</p>

<p>Matilda, as if she had seen his heart as he spoke, clung round
his neck and sobbed on his bosom: he put her peevishly
away, crying "Nonsense, nonsense&mdash;eat your dinner." But
he did not eat himself.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="III_CHAPTER_IX" id="III_CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>About a week after this, Lord Elmwood went out two days
for a visit; consequently Rushbrook was for that time master
of the house. The first morning he went a shooting, and
returning about noon, enquired of Sandford, who was sitting
in the room, if he had taken up a volume of plays left upon
the table. "I read no such things," replied Sandford, and
quitted the room abruptly. Rushbrook then rang for his
servant, and desired him to look for the book, asking him
angrily, "Who had been in the apartment? for he was sure
he had left it there when he went out." The servant withdrew
to enquire, and presently returned with the volume in
his hand, and "Miss Woodley's compliments, she begs your
pardon, Sir, she did not know the book was yours, and hopes
you will excuse the liberty she took."</p>

<p>"Miss Woodley!" cried Rushbrook with surprise, "she
comes so seldom into these apartments, I did not suppose
it was her who had it&mdash;take it back to her instantly, with
my respects, and I beg she will keep it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The man went; but returned with the book again, and
laying it on the table without speaking, was going away;
when Rushbrook, hurt at receiving no second message, said,
"I am afraid, Sir, you did very wrong when you first took
this book from Miss Woodley."</p>

<p>"It was not from her I took it, Sir," replied the man,
"it was from Lady Matilda."</p>

<p>Since he had entered the house, Rushbrook had never
before heard the name of Lady Matilda, he was shocked&mdash;confounded
more than ever&mdash;and to conceal what he felt,
instantly ordered the man out of the room.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Miss Woodley and Matilda were talking
over this trifling occurrence; and frivolous as it was, drew
from it strong conclusions of Rushbrook's insolence and
power. In spite of her pride, the daughter of Lord Elmwood
even wept at the insult she had received on this insignificant
occasion; for the volume being merely taken from her at
Mr. Rushbrook's command, she felt an insult; and the
manner in which it was done by the servant, might contribute
to the offence.</p>

<p>While Miss Woodley and she were upon this conversation,
a note came from Rushbrook to Miss Woodley, wherein he
entreated he might be permitted to see her. She sent a verbal
answer, "She was engaged." He sent again, begging she
would name her own time. But sure of a second denial, he
followed the servant who took the last message, and as Miss
Woodley came out of her apartment into the gallery to speak
to him, Rushbrook presented himself, and told the man to
retire.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rushbrook," said Miss Woodley, "this intrusion is
insupportable; and destitute as you may think me of the
friendship of Lord Elmwood"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the ardour with which Rushbrook was waiting to
express himself, he interrupted her, and caught hold of her
hand.</p>

<p>She immediately snatched it from him, and withdrew into
her chamber.</p>

<p>He followed, saying, in a low voice, "Dear Miss Woodley,
hear me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>At that juncture Lady Matilda, who was in an inner apartment,
came out of it into Miss Woodley's. Perceiving
a gentleman, she stopped short at the door.</p>

<p>Rushbrook cast his eyes upon her, and stood motionless&mdash;his
lips only moved. "Do not depart, Madam," said he,
"without hearing my apology for being here."</p>

<p>Though Matilda had never seen him since her infancy,
there was no occasion to tell her who it was that addressed
her&mdash;his elegant and youthful person, joined to the incident
which had just occurred, convinced her it was Rushbrook:
she looked at him with an air of surprise, but with still more,
of dignity.</p>

<p>"Miss Woodley is severe upon me, Madam," continued
he, "she judges me unkindly; and I am afraid she will prepossess
you with the same unfavourable sentiments."</p>

<p>Still Matilda did not speak, but looked at him with the
same air of dignity.</p>

<p>"If, Lady Matilda," resumed he, "I have offended you,
and must quit you without pardon, I am more unhappy
than I should be with the loss of your father's protection&mdash;more
forlorn, than when an orphan boy, your mother first
took pity on me."</p>

<p>At this last sentence, Matilda turned her eyes on Miss
Woodley, and seemed in doubt what reply she was to
give.</p>

<p>Rushbrook immediately fell upon his knees&mdash;"Oh! Lady
Matilda," cried he, "if you knew the sensations of my heart,
you would not treat me with this disdain."</p>

<p>"We can only judge of those sensations, Mr. Rushbrook,"
said Miss Woodley, "by the effect they have upon your
conduct; and while you insult Lord and Lady Elmwood's
daughter by an intrusion like this, and then ridicule her
abject state by mockeries like these&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose from his knees instantly, and interrupted her,
crying, "What can I do? What am I to say, to make you
change your opinion of me? While Lord Elmwood has been
at home, I have kept an awful distance; and though every
moment I breathed was a wish to cast myself at his daughter's
feet, yet as I feared, Miss Woodley, that you were incensed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
against me, by what means was I to procure an interview
but by stratagem or force? This accident has given a third
method, and I had not strength, I had not courage, to let it
pass. Lord Elmwood will soon return, and we may both
of us be hurried to town immediately&mdash;then how for a
tedious winter could I endure the reflexion that I was
despised, nay, perhaps considered as an object of ingratitude,
by the only child of my deceased benefactress?"</p>

<p>Matilda replied with all her father's haughtiness, "Depend
upon it, Sir, if you should ever enter my thoughts, it will
only be as an object of envy."</p>

<p>"Suffer me then, Madam," said he, "as an earnest that
you do not think worse of me than I merit, suffer me to be
sometimes admitted into your presence&mdash;."</p>

<p>She would scarce permit him to finish the period, before
she replied, "This is the last time, Sir, we shall ever meet,
depend upon it&mdash;unless, indeed, Lord Elmwood should
delegate to you the controul of me&mdash;<i>his</i> commands I never
dispute." And here she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Rushbrook walked towards the window, and did not speak
for some time&mdash;then turning himself to make a reply, both
Matilda and Miss Woodley were somewhat surprised to see,
that he had been shedding tears himself.&mdash;Having conquered
them, he said, "I will not offend you, Madam, by remaining
one moment longer; and I give you my honour, that, upon
no pretence whatever, will I presume to intrude here again.
Professions, I find, have no weight, and only by this obedience
to your orders, can I give a proof of that respect which you
inspire;&mdash;and let the agitation I now feel, convince you,
Lady Matilda, that, with all my seeming good fortune, I am
not happier than yourself." And so much was he agitated
while he delivered this, that it was with difficulty he came
to the conclusion. When he did, he bowed with reverence,
as if leaving the presence of a deity, and retired.</p>

<p>Matilda immediately entered the chamber she had left,
and without casting a single look at Miss Woodley by which
she might guess of the opinion she had formed of Mr. Rushbrook's
conduct. The next time they met they did not even
mention his name; for they were ashamed to own a partiality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in his favour, and were too just to bring any accusation
against him.</p>

<p>But Miss Woodley, the day following, communicated the
intelligence of this visit to Mr. Sandford, who not being
present, and a witness of those marks of humility and respect
which were conspicuous in the deportment of Mr. Rushbrook,
was highly offended at his presumption, and threatened
if he ever dared to force his company there again, he would
acquaint Lord Elmwood with his arrogance, whatever might
be the event. Miss Woodley, however, assured him, she
believed he would have no cause for such a complaint, as
the young man had made the most solemn promise never to
commit the like offence; and she thought it her duty to
enjoin Sandford, till he did repeat it, not to mention the
circumstance, even to Rushbrook himself.</p>

<p>Matilda could not but feel a regard for her father's heir,
in return for that which he had so fervently declared for
her; yet the more favourable her opinion of his mind and
manners, the more he became an object of her jealousy for
the affections of Lord Elmwood, and he was now consequently,
an object of greater sorrow to her, than when she
believed him less worthy. These sentiments were reversed
on his part towards her&mdash;no jealousy intervened to bar his
admiration and esteem&mdash;the beauty of her person, and
grandeur of her mien, not only confirmed, but improved,
the exalted idea he had formed of her previous to their
meeting, and which his affection to both her parents had
inspired. The next time he saw his benefactor, he began
to feel a new esteem and regard for him, for his daughter's
sake; as he had at first an esteem for her, on the foundation
of his love for Lord and Lady Elmwood. He gazed with
wonder at his uncle's insensibility to his own happiness, and
would gladly have led him to the jewel he cast away, though
even his own expulsion should be the fatal consequence.
Such was the youthful, warm, generous, grateful, but unreflecting
mind of Rushbrook.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="III_CHAPTER_X" id="III_CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>After this incident, Miss Woodley left her apartments
less frequently than before&mdash;she was afraid, though till now
mistrust had been a stranger to her heart, she was afraid
that duplicity might be concealed under the apparent
friendship of Rushbrook; it did not indeed appear so from
any part of his behaviour, but she was apprehensive for the
fate of Matilda; she disliked him too, and therefore she
suspected him. Near three weeks she had not now paid
a visit to Lord Elmwood, and though to herself every visit
was a pain, yet as Matilda took a delight in hearing of her
father, what he said, what he did, what his attention seemed
most employed on, and a thousand other circumstantial
informations, in which Sandford would scorn to be half so
particular, it was a deprivation to her, that Miss Woodley
did not go oftener. Now too, the middle of November was
come, and it was expected her father would soon quit the
country.</p>

<p>Partly therefore to indulge her hapless companion, and
partly because it was a duty, Miss Woodley once again paid
Lord Elmwood a morning visit, and staid dinner. Rushbrook
was officiously polite, (for that was the epithet she gave his
attention in relating it to Lady Matilda) yet she owned he
had not that forward impertinence she had formerly discovered
in him, but appeared much more grave and sedate.</p>

<p>"But tell me of my father," said Matilda.</p>

<p>"I was going, my dear&mdash;but don't be concerned&mdash;don't
let it vex you."</p>

<p>"What? what?" cried Matilda, frightened by the
preface.</p>

<p>"Why, on my observing that I thought Mr. Rushbrook
looked paler than usual, and appeared not to be in perfect
health, (which was really the case) your father expressed the
greatest anxiety imaginable; he said he could not bear to
see him look so ill, begged him, with all the tenderness of
a parent, to take the advice of a physician, and added a
thousand other affectionate things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"I detest Mr. Rushbrook," said Matilda, with her eyes
flashing indignation.</p>

<p>"Nay, for shame," returned Miss Woodley; "do you
suppose I told you this, to make you hate him?"</p>

<p>"No, there was no occasion for that," replied Matilda;
"my sentiments (though I have never before avowed them)
were long ago formed; he was always an object which added
to my unhappiness; but since his daring intrusion into my
apartments, he has been an object of my hatred."</p>

<p>"But now, perhaps, I may tell you something to please
you," cried Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" said Matilda, with indifference;
for the first intelligence had hurt her spirits too much to
suffer her to listen with pleasure to anything.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rushbrook," continued Miss Woodley, "replied to
your father, that his indisposition was but a slight nervous
fever, and he would defer a physician's advice till he went to
London"&mdash;on which Lord Elmwood said, "And when do you
expect to be there?"&mdash;he replied, "Within a week or two,
I suppose, my Lord." But your father answered, "I do not
mean to go myself till after Christmas." "No indeed, my
Lord!" said Mr. Sandford, with surprise: "you have not
passed your Christmas here these many years." "No,"
returned your father; "but I think I feel myself more
attached to this house at present, than ever I did in my
life."</p>

<p>"You imagine, then, my father thought of me, when he
said this?" cried Matilda eagerly.</p>

<p>"But I may be mistaken," replied Miss Woodley. "I leave
you to judge. Though I am sure Mr. Sandford imagined
he thought of you, for I saw a smile over his whole face
immediately."</p>

<p>"Did you, Miss Woodley?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it appeared on every feature except his lips; those
he kept fast closed, for fear Lord Elmwood should perceive it."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley, with all her minute intelligence, did not
however acquaint Matilda, that Rushbrook followed her to
the window when the Earl was out of the room, and Sandford
half asleep at the other end of it, and inquired respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>fully
but anxiously for <i>her</i>; adding, "It is my concern for
Lady Matilda which makes me thus indisposed: I suffer
more than she does; but I am not permitted to tell her so,
nor can I hope, Miss Woodley, you will." She replied, "You
are right, Sir." Nor did she reveal this conversation, while
not a sentence that passed except that, was omitted.</p>

<p>When Christmas arrived, Lord Elmwood had many convivial
days at Elmwood House, but Matilda was never mentioned
by one of his guests, and most probably was never
thought of. During all those holidays, she was unusually
melancholy, but sunk into the deepest dejection when she
was told the day was fixed, on which her father was to return
to town. On the morning of that day she wept incessantly;
and all her consolation was, "She would go to the chamber
window that was fronting the door through which he was
to pass to his carriage, and for the first time, and most
probably for the last time in her life, behold him."</p>

<p>This design was soon forgot in another:&mdash;"She would
rush boldly into the apartment where he was, and at his feet
take leave of him for ever&mdash;she would lay hold of his hands,
clasp his knees, provoke him to spurn her, which would be
joy in comparison to this cruel indifference." In the bitterness
of her grief, she once called upon her mother, and
reproached her memory&mdash;but the moment she recollected
this offence, (which was almost instantaneously) she became
all mildness and resignation. "What have I said?" cried
she; "Dear, dear saint, forgive me; and for your sake I will
bear all with patience&mdash;I will not groan, I will not even sigh
again&mdash;this task I set myself to atone for what I have dared
to utter."</p>

<p>While Lady Matilda laboured under this variety of sensations,
Miss Woodley was occupied in bewailing and endeavouring
to calm her sorrows&mdash;and Lord Elmwood, with
Rushbrook, was ready to set off. The Earl, however,
loitered, and did not once seem in haste to be gone. When
at last he got up to depart, Sandford thought he pressed his
hand, and shook it with more warmth than ever he had done
in his life. Encouraged by this supposition, Sandford said,
"My Lord, won't you condescend to take your leave of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Miss Woodley?"</p>


<p>"Certainly, Sandford," replied he, and
seemed glad of an excuse to sit down again.</p>

<p>Impressed with the idea of the state in which she had left
his only child, Miss Woodley, when she came before Lord
Elmwood to bid him farewell, was pale, trembling, and in
tears. Sandford, notwithstanding his patron's apparently
kind humour, was shocked at the construction he must put
upon her appearance, and cried, "What, Miss Woodley, are
you not recovered of your illness yet?" Lord Elmwood,
however, took no notice of her looks, but after wishing her
her health, walked slowly out of the house; turning back
frequently and speaking to Sandford, or to some other
person who was behind him, as if part of his thoughts were
left behind, and he went with reluctance.</p>

<p>When he had quitted the room where Miss Woodley was,
Rushbrook, timid before her, as she had been before her
benefactor, went up to her, all humility, and said, "Miss
Woodley, we ought to be friends: our concern, our devotion
is paid to the same objects, and one common interest should
teach us to be friendly."</p>

<p>She made no reply.&mdash;"Will you permit me to write to you
when I am away?" said he; "You may wish to hear of
Lord Elmwood's health, and of what changes may take
place in his resolutions.&mdash;Will you permit me?" At that
moment a servant came and said, "Sir, my Lord is in the
carriage, and waiting for you." He hastened away, and Miss
Woodley was relieved from the pain of giving him a denial.</p>

<p>No sooner was the chaise, with all its attendants, out of
sight, than Lady Matilda was conducted by Miss Woodley
from her lonely retreat, into that part of the house from
whence her father had just departed&mdash;and she visited every
spot where he had so long resided, with a pleasing curiosity
that for a while diverted her grief. In the breakfast and
dining rooms, she leaned over those seats with a kind of filial
piety, on which she was told he had been accustomed to sit.
And, in the library, she took up with filial delight, the pen
with which he had been writing; and looked with the most
curious attention into those books that were laid upon his
reading desk. But a hat, lying on one of the tables, gave her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
a sensation beyond any other she experienced on this occasion&mdash;in
that trifling article of his dress, she thought she saw
himself, and held it in her hand with pious reverence.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Lord Elmwood and Rushbrook were
proceeding on the road, with hearts not less heavy than those
which they had left at Elmwood House; though neither of
them could so well define the cause of this oppression, as
Matilda could account for the weight which oppressed her's.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Young as Lady Matilda was during the life of her mother,
neither her youth, nor the recluse state in which she lived,
had precluded her from the notice and solicitations of a nobleman
who had professed himself her lover. Viscount Margrave
had an estate not far distant from the retreat Lady Elmwood
had chosen; and being devoted to the sports of the country,
he seldom quitted it for any of those joys which the town
offered. He was a young man, of a handsome person, and
was, what his neighbours called, "A man of spirit." He was
an excellent fox-hunter, and as excellent a companion over
his bottle at the end of the chace&mdash;he was prodigal of his
fortune, where his pleasures were concerned, and as those
pleasures were chiefly social, his sporting companions and
his mistresses (for these were also of the plural number)
partook largely of his wealth.</p>

<p>Two months previous to Lady Elmwood's death, Miss
Woodley and Lady Matilda were taking their usual walk in
some fields and lanes near to their house, when chance threw
Lord Margrave in their way during a thunder storm in which
they were suddenly caught; and he had the satisfaction to
convey his new acquaintances to their home in his coach,
safe from the fury of the elements. Grateful for the service
he had rendered them, Miss Woodley and her charge, permitted
him to enquire occasionally after their health, and
would sometimes see him. The story of Lady Elmwood was
known to Lord Margrave, and as he beheld her daughter
with a passion such as he had been unused to overcome, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
indulged it with the probable hope, that on the death of
the mother Lord Elmwood would receive his child, and
perhaps accept him as his son-in-law. Wedlock was not the
plan which Lord Margrave had ever proposed to himself
for happiness; but the excess of his love on this new occasion,
subdued all the resolutions he had formed against the
married state; and not daring to hope for the consummation
of his wishes by any other means, he suffered himself
to look forward to that, as his only resource. No sooner was
the long expected death of Lady Elmwood arrived, than he
waited with impatience to hear that Lady Matilda was sent
for and acknowledged by her father; for he meant to be the
first to lay before Lord Elmwood his pretensions as a suitor.
But those pretensions were founded on the vague hopes of
a lover only; and Miss Woodley, to whom he first declared
them, said every thing possible to convince him of their
fallacy. As to the object of his passion, she was not only
insensible, but wholly inattentive to all that was said to her
on the subject. Lady Elmwood died without ever being
disturbed with it; for her daughter did not even remember
his proposals so as to repeat them again, and Miss Woodley
thought it prudent to conceal from her friend, every new
incident which might give her cause for new anxieties.</p>

<p>When Sandford and the ladies left the north and came to
Elmwood House, so much were their thoughts employed with
other ideas, that Lord Margrave did not occupy a place; and
during the whole time they had been at their new abode,
they had never once heard of him. He had, nevertheless, his
whole mind fixed upon Lady Matilda, and had placed spies
in the neighbourhood to inform him of every circumstance
relating to her situation. Having imbibed an aversion to
matrimony, he heard with but little regret, that there was
no prospect of her ever becoming her father's heir, while such
an information gave him the hope of obtaining her, upon the
terms of a mistress.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood's departure to town forwarded this hope,
and flattering himself that the humiliating state in which
Matilda must feel herself in the house of her father might
gladly induce her to take shelter under any other protection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
he boldly advanced as soon as the Earl was gone, to make such
overture as his wishes and his vanity told him, could not be
rejected.</p>

<p>Inquiring for Miss Woodley, he easily gained admittance;
but at the sight of so much modesty and dignity in the
person of Matilda, the appearance of so much good will, and
yet such circumspection in her companion; and charmed
at the good sense and proper spirit which were always
apparent in the manners of Sandford, he fell once more into
the despondency of never becoming to Lady Matilda any
thing of more importance to his reputation, than a husband.</p>

<p>Even that humble hope was sometimes denied him, while
Sandford set forth the impropriety of troubling Lord Elmwood
on such a subject at present; and while the Viscount's
penetration, small as it was, discovered in his fair one, more
to discourage, than to favour his wishes. Plunged, however,
too deep in his passion to emerge from it in haste, he meant
still to visit, and wait for a change to happier circumstances,
when he was peremptorily desired by Mr. Sandford to desist
from ever coming again.</p>

<p>"And why, Mr. Sandford?" cried he.</p>

<p>"For two reasons, my Lord;&mdash;in the first place, your visits
might be displeasing to Lord Elmwood; in the next place,
I know they are so to his daughter."</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to be addressed so plainly, particularly in
a case where his heart was interested, he nevertheless submitted
with patience; but in his own mind determined how
long this patience should continue&mdash;no longer than it served
as the means to prove his obedience, and by that artifice, to
secure his better reception at some future period.</p>

<p>On his return home, cheered with the huzzas of his jovial
companions, he began to consult those friends, what scheme
was best to be adopted for the accomplishment of his desires.
Some, boldly advised application to the father in defiance to
the old priest; but that was the very last method his Lordship
himself approved, as marriage must inevitably have
followed Lord Elmwood's consent: besides, though a Peer,
Lord Margrave was unused to rank with Peers; and even
the formality of an interview with one of his equals, carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
along with it a terror, or at least a fatigue, to a rustic Baron.
Others of his companions advised seduction; but happily
the Viscount possessed no arts of this kind, to affect a heart
joined with such an understanding as Matilda's. There were
not wanting among his most favourite counsellors some, who
painted the superior triumph and gratification of force;
those assured him there was nothing to apprehend under this
head, as from the behaviour of Lord Elmwood to his child,
it was more than probable, he would be utterly indifferent
as to any violence that might be offered her. This last advice
seemed inspired by the aid of wine; and no sooner had the
wine freely circulated, than this was always the expedient,
which appeared by far the best.</p>

<p>While Lord Margrave alternately cherished his hopes and
his fears in the country, Rushbrook in town gave way to his
fears only. Every day of his life made him more acquainted
with the firm, unshaken temper of Lord Elmwood, and every
day whispered more forcibly to him, that pity, gratitude,
and friendship, strong and affectionate as these passions are,
were weak and cold to that, which had gained the possession
of his heart&mdash;he doubted, but he did not long doubt, that,
which he felt was love. "And yet," said he to himself, "it
is love of such a kind, as arising from causes independent of
the object itself can scarce deserve that sacred name. Did I
not love Lady Matilda before I beheld her?&mdash;for her mother's
sake I loved her&mdash;and even for her father's. Should I have
felt the same affection for her, had she been the child of other
parents? No. Or should I have felt that sympathetic
tenderness which now preys upon my health, had not her
misfortunes excited it? No." Yet the love which is the
result of gratitude and pity only, he thought had little claim
to rank with his; and after the most deliberate and deep
reflection, he concluded with this decisive opinion&mdash;He had
loved Lady Matilda, in <i>whatever state</i>, in <i>whatever circumstances</i>;
and that the tenderness he felt towards her, and
the anxiety for her happiness before he knew her, extreme
as they were, were yet cool and dispassionate sensations,
compared to those which her person and demeanour had incited&mdash;and
though he acknowledged, that by the preceding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
sentiments, his heart was softened, prepared, and moulded,
as it were, to receive this last impression, yet the violence
of his passion told him that genuine love, if not the basis on
which it was founded, had been the certain consequence.
With a strict scrutiny into his heart he sought this knowledge,
but arrived at it with a regret that amounted to despair.</p>

<p>To shield him from despondency, he formed in his mind
a thousand visions, displaying the joys of his union with
Lady Matilda; but her father's implacability confounded
them all. Lord Elmwood was a man who made few resolutions&mdash;but
those were the effect of deliberation; and as he
was not the least capricious or inconstant in his temper, they
were resolutions which no probable event could shake.
Love, that produces wonders, that seduces and subdues the
most determined and rigid spirits, had in two instances
overcome the inflexibility of Lord Elmwood; he married
Lady Elmwood contrary to his determination, because he
loved; and for the sake of this beloved object, he had, contrary
to his resolution, taken under his immediate care young
Rushbrook; but the magic which once enchanted away
this spirit of immutability was no more&mdash;Lady Elmwood was
no more, and the charm was broken.</p>

<p>As Miss Woodley was deprived of the opportunity of
desiring Rushbrook not to write, when he asked her the
permission, he passed one whole morning, in the gratification
of forming and writing a letter to her, which he thought
might possibly be shewn to Matilda. As he dared not touch
upon any of those circumstances in which he was the most
interested, this, joined to the respect he wished to pay the
lady to whom he wrote, limited his letter to about twenty
lines; yet the studious manner with which these lines were
dictated, the hope that they might, and the fear that they
might not, be seen and regarded by Lady Matilda, rendered
the task an anxiety so pleasing, that he could have wished
it might have lasted for a year; and in this tendency to
magnify trifles, was discoverable, the never-failing symptom
of ardent love.</p>

<p>A reply to this formal address, was a reward he wished for
with impatience, but he wished in vain; and in the midst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of his chagrin at the disappointment, a sorrow, little thought
of, occurred, and gave him a perturbation of mind he had
never before experienced. Lord Elmwood proposed a wife
to him; and in a way so assured of his acquiescence, that
if Rushbrook's life had depended upon his daring to dispute
his benefactor's will, he would not have had the courage to
have done so. There was, however, in his reply, and his
embarrassment, something which his uncle distinguished from
a free concurrence; and looking stedfastly at him, he said,
in that stern manner which he now almost invariably
adopted,</p>

<p>"You have no engagements, I suppose! Have made no
previous promises!"</p>

<p>"None on earth, my Lord," replied Rushbrook candidly.</p>

<p>"Nor have you disposed of your heart?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord," replied he; but not candidly&mdash;nor with
any appearance of candour: for though he spoke hastily, it
was rather like a man frightened than assured. He hurried
to tell the falsehood he thought himself obliged to tell, that
the pain and shame might be over; but there he was deceived&mdash;the
lie once told was as troublesome as in the conception,
and added another confusion to the first.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood now fixed his eyes upon him with a sullen
contempt, and rising from his chair, said, "Rushbrook, if
you have been so inconsiderate as to give away your heart,
tell me so at once, and tell me the object."</p>

<p>Rushbrook shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>"I here," continued the Earl, "tolerate the first untruth
you ever told me, as the false assertion of a lover; and give
you an opportunity of recalling it&mdash;but after this moment,
it is a lie between man and man&mdash;a lie to your friend and
father, and I will not forgive it."</p>

<p>Rushbrook stood silent, confused, alarmed, and bewildered
in his thoughts. Lord Elmwood proceeded:</p>

<p>"Name the person, if there is any, on whom you have
bestowed your heart; and though I do not give you the hope
that I shall not censure your folly, I will at least not reproach
you for having at first denied it."</p>

<p>To repeat these words in writing, the reader must condemn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the young man that he could hesitate to own he loved, if he
was even afraid to name the object of his passion; but his
interrogator had made the two answers inseparable, so that
all evasions of the second, Rushbrook knew would be fruitless,
after having avowed the first&mdash;and how could he confess the
latter? The absolute orders he received from the steward
on his first return from his travels, were, "Never to mention
his daughter, any more than his late wife, before Lord
Elmwood." The fault of having rudely intruded into Lady
Matilda's presence, rushed also upon his mind; for he did
not even dare to say, by what means he had beheld her. But
more than all, the threatening manner in which this rational
and apparently conciliating speech was uttered, the menaces,
the severity which sat upon the Earl's countenance while
he delivered those moderate words, might have intimidated
a man wholly independent, and less used to fear than his
nephew had been.</p>

<p>"You make no answer, Sir," said Lord Elmwood, after
waiting a few moments for his reply.</p>

<p>"I have only to say, my Lord," returned Rushbrook,
"that although my heart may be totally disengaged, I may
yet be disinclined to marriage."</p>

<p>"May! May! Your heart <i>may</i> be disengaged," repeated
he. "Do you dare to reply to me equivocally, when I have
asked a positive answer?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am not positive myself, my Lord; but I will
enquire into the state of my mind, and make you acquainted
with it very soon."</p>

<p>As the angry demeanour of his uncle affected Rushbrook
with fear, so that fear, powerfully (but with proper manliness)
expressed, again softened the displeasure of Lord Elmwood;
and seeing and pitying his nephew's sensibility, he now
changed his austere voice, and said mildly, but firmly,</p>

<p>"I give you a week to consult with yourself; at the
expiration of that time I shall talk with you again, and
I command you to be then prepared to speak, not only
without deceit, but without hesitation." He left the room
at these words, and left Rushbrook released from a fate,
which his apprehensions had beheld impending that moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>He had now a week to call his thoughts together, to weigh
every circumstance, and to determine whether implicitly to
submit to Lord Elmwood's recommendation of a wife, or
to revolt from it, and see another, with more subserviency
to his will, appointed his heir.</p>

<p>Undetermined how to act upon this trial which was to
decide his future destiny, Rushbrook suffered so poignant an
uncertainty, that he became at length ill, and before the end
of the week that was allotted him for his reply, he was confined
to his bed in a high fever. Lord Elmwood was extremely
affected at his indisposition; he gave him every care he could
bestow, and even much of his personal attendance. This last
favour had a claim upon the young man's gratitude, superior
to every other obligation which since his infancy his benefactor
had conferred; and he was at times so moved by
those marks of kindness he received, that he would form the
intention of tearing from his heart every trace that Lady
Matilda had left there, and as soon as his health would permit
him, obey, to the utmost of his views, every wish his uncle had
conceived. Yet again, her pitiable situation presented itself
to his compassion, and her beauteous person to his love.
Divided between the claims of obligation to the father,
and tender attachment to the daughter, his illness was increased
by the tortures of his mind, and he once sincerely
wished for that death, of which he was in danger, to free
him from the dilemma in which his affections had involved
him.</p>

<p>At the time his disorder was at the height, and he lay
complaining of the violence of his fever, Lord Elmwood,
taking his hand, asked him, "If there was any thing he could
do for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my Lord, a great deal:" he replied eagerly.</p>

<p>"What is it, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Oh! my Lord," replied he, "that is what I must not
tell you."</p>

<p>"Defer it then till you are well:" said Lord Elmwood;
afraid of being surprised, or affected by the state of his health,
into any promises which he might hereafter find the impropriety
of granting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when I recover, my Lord, you give me leave to
reveal to you my wishes, let them be what they will?"</p>

<p>His uncle hesitated&mdash;&mdash;but seeing an anxiety for the
answer, by his raising himself upon his elbow in the bed and
staring wildly, Lord Elmwood at last said, "Certainly&mdash;Yes,
yes," as a child is answered for its quiet.</p>

<p>That Lord Elmwood could have no idea what the real
petition was, which Rushbrook meant to present him is
certain; but it is certain he expected he had some request
to make, with which it might be wrong for him to comply,
and therefore he avoided hearing what it was; for great as
his compassion for him was in his present state, it was not of
sufficient force to urge him to give a promise he did not
mean to perform. Rushbrook, on his part was pleased with
the assurance he might speak when he was restored to health;
but no sooner was his fever abated, and his senses perfectly
recovered from the slight derangement his malady had
occasioned, than the lively remembrance of what he had
hinted, alarmed him, and he was even afraid to look his kind,
but awful relation in the face. Lord Elmwood's cheerfulness,
however, on his returning health, and his undiminished
attention, soon convinced him that he had nothing to fear.
But, alas! he found too, that he had nothing to hope. As
his health re-established, his wishes re-established also, and
with his wishes, his despair.</p>

<p>Convinced now, that his nephew had something on his
mind which he feared to reveal, the Earl no longer doubted
but that some youthful attachment had armed him against
any marriage he should propose; but he had so much pity
for his present weak state, to delay that further inquiry which
he had threatened before his illness, to a time when he should
be entirely restored.</p>

<p>It was the end of May before Rushbrook was able to partake
in the usual routine of the day&mdash;the country was now prescribed
him as the means of complete restoration; and as Lord
Elmwood designed to leave London some time in June, he
advised him to go to Elmwood House a week or two before
him; this advice was received with delight, and a letter was
sent to Mr. Sandford to prepare for Mr. Rushbrook's arrival.</p>

<p>During the illness of Rushbrook, news had been sent of his
danger, from the servants in town to those at Elmwood
House, and Lady Matilda expressed compassion when she
was told of it&mdash;she began to conceive, the instant she thought
he would soon die, that his visit to her had merit rather than
impertinence in its design, and that he might possibly be
a more deserving man, than she had supposed him to be.
Even Sandford and Miss Woodley, began to recollect qualifications
he possessed, which they never had reflected on before,
and Miss Woodley in particular, reproached herself that she
had been so severe and inattentive to him. Notwithstanding
the prospects his death pointed out to her, it was with infinite
joy she heard he was recovered; nor was Sandford less satisfied;
for he had treated the young man too unkindly not to
dread, lest any ill should befall him; but although he was
glad to hear of his restored health, when he was informed he
was coming down to Elmwood House for a few weeks in the
style of its master, Sandford, with all his religious and
humane principles, could not help thinking, "That if the
lad had been properly prepared to die, he had been as well
out of the world as in it."</p>

<p>He was still less his friend when he saw him arrive with
his usual florid complexion: had he come pale and sickly,
Sandford had been kind to him; but in apparently good
health and spirits, he could not form his lips to tell him he
was "Glad to see him."</p>

<p>On his arrival, Matilda, who for five months had been at
large, secluded herself as she would have done upon the
arrival of Lord Elmwood; but with far different sensations.
Notwithstanding her restriction on the latter occasion, the
residence of her father in that house had been a source
of pleasure, rather than of sorrow to her; but from the
abode of Rushbrook she derived punishment alone.</p>

<p>When, from inquiries, Rushbrook found that on his
approach, Matilda had retired to her own confined apartments,
the thought was torture to him; it was the hope of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
seeing and conversing with her, of being admitted at all
times to her society as the mistress of the house, that had
raised his spirits, and effected his perfect cure beyond any
other cause; and he was hurt to the greatest degree at this
respect, or rather contempt, shown to him by her retreat.</p>

<p>It was, nevertheless, a subject too delicate for him to touch
upon in any one sense&mdash;an invitation for her company on his
part, might carry the appearance of superior authority, and
an affected condescension, which he justly considered as the
worst of all insults. And yet, how could he support the idea
that his visit had placed the daughter of his benefactor, as
a dependent stranger in that house, where in reality <i>he</i> was
the dependent, and she the lawful heir? For two or three
days he suffered the torment of these reflections, hoping
that he should come to an explanation of all he felt, by
a fortunate meeting with Miss Woodley; but when that
meeting occurred, though he observed she talked to him with
less reserve than she had formerly done, and even gave some
proofs of the native goodness of her disposition, yet she
scrupulously avoided naming Lady Matilda; and when he
diffidently inquired of her health, a cold restraint overspread
Miss Woodley's face, and she left him instantly. To Sandford
it was still more difficult for him to apply; for though
frequently together, they were never sociable; and as Sandford
seldom disguised his feelings, to Rushbrook he was
always extremely severe, and sometimes unmannerly.</p>

<p>In this perplexed situation, the country air was rather of
detriment than service to the invalid; and had he not, like
a true lover, clung fast to hope, while he could perceive
nothing but despair, he would have returned to town, rather
than by his stay have placed in a subordinate state, the object
of his adoration. Persisting in his hopes, he one morning
met Miss Woodley in the garden, and engaging her a longer
time than usual in conversation, at last obtained her promise
"She would that day dine with him and Mr. Sandford."
But no sooner had she parted from him, than she repented
of her consent; and upon communicating it, Matilda, for
the first time in her life, darted upon her kind companion,
a look of the most cutting reproach and haughty resent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>ment.
Miss Woodley's own sentiments had upbraided her
before; but she was not prepared to receive so pointed
a mark of disapprobation from her young friend, till now
duteous and humble to her as to a mother, and not less
affectionate. Her heart was too susceptible to bear this
disrespectful and contumelious frown, from the object of her
long-devoted care and concern; the tears instantly covered
her face, and she laid her hands upon her heart, as if she
thought it would break. Matilda was moved, but she
possessed too much of the manly resentment of her father, to
discover what she felt for the first few minutes. Miss Woodley,
who had given so many tears to her sorrows, but never
till now, one to her anger, had a deeper sense of this indifference,
than of the anger itself, and to conceal what she
suffered, left the room. Matilda, who had been till this time
working at her needle, seemingly composed, now let her work
drop from her hand, and sat for a while in a deep reverie.
At length she rose up, and followed Miss Woodley to the other
apartment. She entered grave, majestic and apparently
serene, while her poor heart fluttered with a thousand distressing
sensations. She approached Miss Woodley (who was
still in tears) with silence; and awed by her manners, the
faithful friend of her deceased mother exclaimed, "Dear
Lady Matilda, think no more on what I have done&mdash;do not
resent it any longer, and on my knees I'll beg your pardon."
Miss Woodley rose as she uttered these last words; but
Matilda laid fast hold of her to prevent the posture she offered
to take, and instantly assumed it herself. "Oh, let this be
my atonement!" she cried with the most earnest supplication.</p>

<p>They interchanged forgiveness; and as this reconciliation
was sincere, they each, without reserve, gave their opinion
upon the subject that had caused the misunderstanding;
and it was agreed an apology should be sent to Mr. Rushbrook,
"That Miss Woodley had been suddenly indisposed:"
nor could this be said to differ from the truth, for since what
had passed she was unfit to pay a visit.</p>

<p>Rushbrook, who had been all the morning elated with the
advance he supposed he had made in that lady's favour, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
highly disappointed, vexed, and angry, when this apology
was delivered; nor did he, nor perhaps could he, conceal
what he felt, although his severe observer, Mr. Sandford, was
present.</p>

<p>"I am a very unfortunate man!" said he, as soon as the
servant was gone who brought the message.</p>

<p>Sandford cast his eyes upon him with a look of surprise
and contempt.</p>

<p>"A very unfortunate man indeed, Mr. Sandford," repeated
he, "although you treat my complaint contemptuously."</p>

<p>Sandford made no reply, and seemed above making one.</p>

<p>They sat down to dinner;&mdash;Rushbrook eat scarce any thing,
but drank frequently; Sandford took no notice of either,
but had a book (which was his custom when he dined with
persons whose conversation was not interesting to him) laid
by the side of his plate, which he occasionally looked into, as
the dishes were removing, or other opportunities served.</p>

<p>Rushbrook, just now more hopeless than ever of forming
an acquaintance with Lady Matilda, began to give way to
symptoms of despondency; and they made their first attack,
by urging him, to treat on the same level of familiarity that
he himself was treated, Mr. Sandford, to whom he had, till
now, ever behaved with the most profound tokens of respect.</p>

<p>"Come," said he to him as soon as the dinner was removed,
"lay aside your book and be good company."</p>

<p>Sandford lifted up his eyes upon him&mdash;stared in his face&mdash;and
cast them on the book again.</p>

<p>"Pshaw," continued Rushbrook, "I want a companion;
and as Miss Woodley has disappointed me, I must have your
company."</p>

<p>Sandford now laid his book down upon the table; but
still holding his fingers in the pages he was reading, said,
"And why are you disappointed of Miss Woodley's company?
When people expect what they have no right to
hope, 'tis impertinent assurance to complain they are disappointed."</p>

<p>"I had a right to hope she would come," answered Rushbrook,
"for she promised she would."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what right had you to ask her?"</p>

<p>"The right every one has, to make his time pass as agreeably
as he can."</p>

<p>"But not at the expence of another."</p>

<p>"I believe, Mr. Sandford, it would be a heavy expence to
you, to see me happy; I believe it would cost you even your
own happiness."</p>

<p>"That is a price I have not now to give:" replied Sandford,
and began reading again.</p>

<p>"What, you have already paid it away? No wonder that
at your time of life it should be gone. But what do you
think of my having already squandered mine?"</p>

<p>"I don't think about you;" returned Sandford, without
taking his eyes from the book.</p>

<p>"Can you look me in the face and say that, Mr. Sandford?
No, you cannot&mdash;for you know you <i>do</i> think of me, and you
know you hate me."&mdash;Here he drank two glasses of wine
one after another; "And I can tell you why you hate me,"
continued he: "It is from a cause for which I often hate
myself."</p>

<p>Sandford read on.</p>

<p>"It is on Lady Matilda's account you hate me, and use
me thus."</p>

<p>Sandford put down the book hastily, and put both his
hands by his side.</p>

<p>"Yes," resumed Rushbrook, "you think I am wronging
her."</p>

<p>"I think you insult her," exclaimed Sandford, "by this
rude mention of her name; and I command you at your
peril to desist."</p>

<p>"At my peril! Mr. Sandford? Do you assume the
authority of my Lord Elmwood?"</p>

<p>"I do on this occasion; and if you dare to give your
tongue a freedom"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Rushbrook interrupted him&mdash;"Why then I boldly say,
(and as her friend you ought rather to applaud than resent
it) I boldly say, that my heart suffers so much for her situation,
that I am regardless of my own. I love her father&mdash;I
loved her mother more&mdash;but I love <i>her</i> beyond either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold your licentious tongue," cried Sandford, "or quit
the room."</p>

<p>"Licentious! Oh! the pure thoughts that dwell in her
innocent mind, are not less sensual than mine towards her.
Do you upbraid me with my respect, my pity for her? They
are the sensations which impel me to speak thus undisguised,
even to you, my open&mdash;no, even worse&mdash;my secret enemy!"</p>

<p>"Insult <i>me</i> as you please, Mr. Rushbrook,&mdash;but beware
how you mention Lord Elmwood's daughter."</p>

<p>"Can it be to her dishonour that I pity her? that I would
quit the house this moment never to return, so that she
supplied the place I with-hold from her."</p>

<p>"Go, then;" cried Sandford.</p>

<p>"It would be of no use to her, or I would. But come,
Mr. Sandford, I will dare do as much as you. Only second
me, and I will entreat Lord Elmwood to be reconciled&mdash;to
see and own her."</p>

<p>"Your vanity would be equal to your temerity&mdash;<i>you</i>
entreat? She must greatly esteem those paternal favours
which <i>your</i> entreaties gained her! Do you forget, young
man, how short a time it is, since you were <i>entreated for</i>?"</p>

<p>"I prove that I do not, while this anxiety for Lady Matilda,
arises, from what I feel on that account."</p>

<p>"Remove your anxiety, then, from her to yourself; for
were I to let Lord Elmwood know what has now passed"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is for your own sake, not for mine, if you do not."</p>

<p>"You shall not dare me to it, Mr. Rushbrook." And he
rose from his seat: "You shall not dare me to do you an
injury. But to avoid the temptation, I will never again
come into your company, unless my friend, Lord Elmwood,
be present, to protect me and his child from your insults."</p>

<p>Rushbrook rose in yet more warmth than Sandford</p>

<p>"Have you the injustice to say that I have insulted Lady
Matilda?"</p>

<p>"To speak of her at all, is in you an insult. But you have
done more&mdash;you have dared to visit her&mdash;to force into her
presence and shock her with your offers of services which
she scorns; and with your compassion, which she is above."</p>

<p>"Did she complain to you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"She or her friend did."</p>

<p>"I rather suppose, Mr. Sandford, that you have bribed
some of the servants to reveal this."</p>

<p>"The suspicion becomes Lord Elmwood's heir."</p>

<p>"It becomes the man, who lives in a house with you."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr. Rushbrook, for what has passed this
day&mdash;it has taken a weight off my mind. I thought my disinclination
to you, might perhaps arise from prejudice&mdash;this
conversation has relieved me from those fears, and&mdash;I thank
you." Saying this he calmly walked out of the room, and
left Rushbrook to reflect on what he had been doing.</p>

<p>Heated with the wine he had drank (and which Sandford,
engaged on his book, had not observed) no sooner was he
alone, than he became by degrees cool and repentant.
"What had he done?" was the first question to himself&mdash;"He
had offended Sandford."&mdash;The man, whom reason as
well as prudence had ever taught him to respect, and even to
revere. He had grossly offended the firm friend of Lady
Matilda, by the unreserved and wanton use of her name.
All the retorts he had uttered came now to his memory;
with a total forgetfulness of all that Sandford had said to
provoke them.</p>

<p>He once thought to follow him and beg his pardon; but
the contempt with which he had been treated, more than all
the anger, with-held him.</p>

<p>As he sat forming plans how to retrieve the opinion, ill as
it was, which Sandford formerly entertained of him, he
received a letter from Lord Elmwood, kindly enquiring after
his health, and saying that he should be down early in the
following week. Never were the friendly expressions of his
uncle half so welcome to him; for they served to sooth
his imagination, racked with Sandford's wrath, and his own
displeasure.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>When Sandford acted deliberately, he always acted up to
his duty; it was his duty to forgive Rushbrook, and he did
so&mdash;but he had declared he would never "Be again in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
company unless Lord Elmwood was present;" and with all
his forgiveness, he found an unforgiving gratification, in the
duty, of being obliged to keep his word.</p>

<p>The next day Rushbrook dined alone, while Sandford gave
his company to the ladies. Rushbrook was too proud to
seek to conciliate Sandford by abject concessions, but he
endeavoured to meet him as by accident, and meant to try
what, in such a case, a submissive apology might effect. For
two days all the schemes he formed on that head proved
fruitless; he could never procure even a sight of him. But
on the evening of the third day, taking a lonely walk, he
turned the corner of a grove, and saw in the very path he
was going, Sandford accompanied by Miss Woodley; and,
what agitated him infinitely more, Lady Matilda was with
them. He knew not whether to proceed, or to quit the
path and palpably shun them&mdash;to one, who seemed to put
an unkind construction upon all he said and did, he knew
that to do either, would be to do wrong. In spite of the
propensity he felt to pass so near to Matilda, could he have
known what conduct would have been deemed the most
respectful, whatever painful denial it had cost him, <i>that</i>, he
would have adopted. But undetermined whether to go
forward, or to cross to another path, he still walked on till he
came too nigh to recede: he then, with a diffidence not
affected, but most powerfully felt, pulled off his hat; and
without bowing, stood respectfully silent while the company
passed. Sandford walked on some paces before, and took no
further notice as he went by him, than just touching the
fore part of his hat with his finger. Miss Woodley curtsied
as she followed. But Lady Matilda made a full stop, and said,
in the gentlest accents, "I hope, Mr. Rushbrook, you are
perfectly recovered."</p>

<p>It was the sweetest music he had ever listened to; and he
replied with the most reverential bow, "I am better a great
deal, Ma'am." Then instantly pursued his way as if he did
not dare to utter another syllable.</p>

<p>Sandford seldom found fault with Lady Matilda; not
because he loved her, but because she seldom did wrong&mdash;upon
this occasion, however, he was half inclined to repri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>mand
her; but yet he did not know what to say&mdash;the subsequent
humility of Rushbrook, had taken from the indiscretion
of her speaking to him, and the event could by no means
justify his censure. On hearing her begin to speak, Sandford
had stopped; and as Rushbrook after replying, walked away,
Sandford called to her crossly, "Come, come along." But
at the same time he put out his elbow for her to take hold of
his arm.</p>

<p>She hastened her steps, and did so&mdash;then turning to Miss
Woodley, she said, "I expected you would have spoken to
Mr. Rushbrook; it might have prevented me."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley replied, "I was at a loss what to do;&mdash;when
we met formerly, he always spoke first."</p>

<p>"And he ought now," cried Sandford angrily&mdash;and then
added, with a sarcastic smile, "It is certainly proper that
the <i>superior</i>, should be the first who speaks."</p>

<p>"He did not look as if he thought himself our superior,"
replied Matilda.</p>

<p>"No," returned Sandford, "some people can put on what
looks they please."</p>

<p>"Then while he looks so pale," replied Matilda, "and so
dejected, I can never forbear speaking to him when we meet,
whatever he may think of it."</p>

<p>"And were he and I to meet a hundred, nay a thousand
times," returned Sandford, "I don't think I should ever
speak to him again."</p>

<p>"Bless me! what for, Mr. Sandford?" cried Matilda&mdash;for
Sandford, who was not a man that repeated little incidents,
had never mentioned the circumstance of their
quarrel.</p>

<p>"I have taken such a resolution," answered he, "yet
I bear him no enmity."</p>

<p>As this short reply indicated that he meant to say no more,
no more was asked; and the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Rushbrook, happier than he had been
for months, intoxicated with joy at that voluntary mark of
civility he had received from Lady Matilda, felt his heart
so joyous, and so free from every particle of malice, that
he resolved, in the humblest manner, to make atonement for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the violation of decorum he had lately committed against
Mr. Sandford.</p>

<p>Too happy, at this time, to suffer a mortification from
any indignities he might receive, he sent his servant to him
into his study, as soon as he was returned home, to beg to
know "If he might be permitted to wait upon him, with
a message he had to deliver from Lord Elmwood."</p>

<p>The servant returned&mdash;"Mr. Sandford desired he would
send the message by him, or the house-steward." This was
highly affronting; but Rushbrook was not in a humour to
be offended, and he sent again, begging he would admit
him; but the answer was, "He was busy."</p>

<p>Thus wholly defeated in his hopes of reconciliation, his
new transports felt an allay, and the few days that remained
before Lord Elmwood came, he passed in solitary musing,
and ineffectual walks and looks towards that path in which
he had met Matilda&mdash;she came that way no more&mdash;indeed
scarce quitted her apartment, in the practice of that confinement
she was to experience on the arrival of her father.</p>

<p>All her former agitations now returned. On the day he
arrived she wept&mdash;all the night she did not sleep&mdash;and the
name of Rushbrook again became hateful to her. The Earl
came in extremely good health and spirits, but appeared
concerned to find Rushbrook less well than when he went
from town. Sandford was now under the necessity of being
in Rushbrook's company, yet he would never speak to him
but when he was obliged; or look at him, but when he could
not help it. Lord Elmwood observed this conduct, yet he
neither wondered, or was offended at it&mdash;he had perceived
what little esteem Sandford showed his nephew from his
first return; but he forgave, in Sandford's humour, a
thousand faults he would not forgive in any other; nor did
he deem this one of his greatest faults, knowing the demand
upon his partiality from another object.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley waited on Lord Elmwood as formerly;
dined with him, and related, as heretofore, to the attentive
Matilda, all that passed.</p>

<p>About this time Lord Margrave, deprived by the season
of all the sports of the field, felt his love for Matilda (which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
had been violent, even though divided with the love of
hunting) now too strong to be subdued; and he resolved,
though reluctantly, to apply to her father for his consent to
their union; but writing to Sandford this resolution, he was
once more repulsed, and charged as a man of honour, to
forbear to disturb the tranquillity of the family by any
application of the kind. To this, Sandford received no
answer; for the peer, highly incensed at his mistress's
repugnance to him, determined more firmly than ever to
consult his own happiness alone; and as that depended
merely upon his obtaining her, he cared not by what method
it was effected.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Lord Elmwood came into the
country, as he was riding one morning, his horse fell with
him, and crushed his leg in so unfortunate a manner, as to
be at first pronounced of dangerous consequence. He was
brought home in a post chaise, and Matilda heard of the
accident with more grief than would, perhaps, on such an
occasion, appertain to the most fondled child.</p>

<p>In consequence of the pain he suffered, his fever was one
night very high; and Sandford, who seldom quitted his
apartment, went frequently to his bedside, every time with
the secret hope he should hear him ask to see his daughter&mdash;he
was every time disappointed&mdash;yet he saw him shake, with
a cordial friendship, the hand of Rushbrook, as if he delighted
in seeing those he loved.</p>

<p>The danger in which Lord Elmwood was supposed to be,
was but of short duration, and his sudden recovery succeeded.
Matilda, who had wept, moaned, and watched during the
crisis of his illness, when she heard he was amending, exclaimed,
(with a kind of surprise at the novelty of the sensation)
"And this is joy that I feel! Oh! I never till now
knew, what those persons felt who experienced joy."</p>

<p>Nor did she repine, like Mr. Sandford and Miss Woodley,
at her father's inattention to her during his malady, for she
did not hope like them&mdash;she did not hope he would behold
her, even in dying.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding his seeming indifference, while his
indisposition continued, no sooner was he recovered so as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
receive the congratulations of his friends, than there was no
one person he evidently showed so much satisfaction at
seeing, as Miss Woodley. She waited upon him timorously,
and with more than ordinary distaste at his late conduct,
when he put out his hand with the utmost warmth to receive
her; drew her to him; saluted her, (an honour he had never
in his life conferred before) with signs of the sincerest friendship
and affection. Sandford was present; and ever associating
the idea of Matilda with Miss Woodley, felt his heart
bound with a triumph it had not enjoyed for many a day.</p>

<p>Matilda listened with delight to the recital Miss Woodley
gave on her return, and many times while it lasted exclaimed,
"She was happy." But poor Matilda's sudden transports of
joy, which she termed happiness, were not made for long
continuance; and if she ever found cause for gladness, she
far oftener had motives for grief.</p>

<p>As Mr. Sandford was sitting with her and Miss Woodley,
one evening about a week after, a person rang at the bell and
inquired for him: on being told of it by the servant, he went
to the door of the apartment, and cried, "Oh! is it you?
Come in." An elderly man entered, who had been for many
years the head gardener at Elmwood House; a man of
honesty and sobriety, and with an indigent family of aged
parents, children, and other relations, who subsisted wholly
on the income arising from his place. The ladies, as well as
Sandford, knew him well, and they all, almost at once, asked,
"What was the matter?" for his looks told them something
distressful had befallen him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir!" said he to Sandford, "I come to intreat your
interest."</p>

<p>"In what, Edwards?" said Sandford with a mild voice;
for when his assistance was supplicated in distress, his rough
tones always took a plaintive key.</p>

<p>"My Lord has discharged me from his service!" (returned
Edwards trembling, and the tears starting in his eyes) "I am
undone, Mr. Sandford, unless you plead for me."</p>

<p>"I will," said Sandford, "I will."</p>

<p>"And yet I am almost afraid of your success," replied the
man, "for my Lord has ordered me out of his house this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
moment; and though I knelt down to him to be heard, he
had no pity."</p>

<p>Matilda sighed from the bottom of her heart, and yet she
envied this poor man, who had been kneeling to her father.</p>

<p>"What was your offence?" cried Sandford.</p>

<p>The man hesitated; then looking at Matilda, said, "I'll
tell you, Sir, some other time."</p>

<p>"Did you name me, before Lord Elmwood?" cried she
eagerly, and terrified.</p>

<p>"No, Madam," replied he, "but I unthinkingly spoke of
my poor Lady who is dead and gone."</p>

<p>Matilda burst into tears.</p>

<p>"How came you to do so mad a thing?" cried Sandford;
and the encouragement which his looks had once given him,
now fled from his face.</p>

<p>"It was unthinkingly," repeated Edwards; "I was showing
my Lord some plans for the new walks, and told him,
among other things, that her Ladyship had many years ago
approved of them. 'Who?' cried he. Still I did not call
to mind, but said, 'Lady Elmwood, Sir, while you were
abroad.'&mdash;As soon as these words were delivered, I saw my
doom in his looks, and he commanded me to quit his house
and service that instant."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Sandford, shaking his head, "I can do
nothing for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, you know you have more power over my Lord
than any body&mdash;and perhaps you may be able to save me
and all mine from misery."</p>

<p>"I would, if I could," replied Sandford quickly.</p>

<p>"You can but try, Sir."</p>

<p>Matilda was all this while bathed in tears; nor was Miss
Woodley much less affected&mdash;Lady Elmwood was before their
eyes&mdash;Matilda beheld her in her dying moments; Miss
Woodley saw her as the gay ward of Dorriforth.</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Rushbrook," said Sandford, "prevail on him to
speak for you; he has more power than I have."</p>

<p>"He has not enough, then," replied Edwards, "for he was
in the room with my Lord when what I have told you
happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did he say nothing?" asked Sandford.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir; he offered to speak in my behalf, but my Lord
interrupted him, and ordered him out of the room&mdash;he
instantly went."</p>

<p>Sandford, now observing the effect which this narration
had on the two ladies, led the man to his own apartments,
and there assured him he dared not undertake his cause;
but that if time or chance should happily make an alteration
in his Lord's disposition, he would be the first who would
endeavour to replace him.&mdash;Edwards was obliged to submit;
and before the next day at noon, his pleasant house by the
side of the park, his garden, and his orchard, which he had
occupied above twenty years, were cleared of their old
inhabitant, and all his wretched family.</p>

<p>This melancholy incident, perhaps affected Matilda and
all the friends of the deceased Lady Elmwood, beyond any
other that had occurred since her death. A few days after
this circumstance, Miss Woodley, in order to divert the
disconsolate mind of Lady Matilda, (and in the hope of bringing
her some little anecdotes, to console her for that which
had given her so much pain) waited upon Lord Elmwood in
his library, and borrowed some books out of it. He was now
perfectly well from his fall, and received her with his usual
politeness, but, of course, not with that peculiar warmth
which he had discovered when he received her just after his
illness. Rushbrook was in the library at the same time; he
shewed her several beautiful prints which Lord Elmwood
had just received from London, and appeared anxious to
entertain and give tokens of his esteem and respect for her.
But what gave her pleasure beyond any other attention, was,
that after she had taken (by the aid of Rushbrook) about a dozen
volumes from different shelves, and had laid them together,
saying she would send her servant to fetch them; Lord
Elmwood went eagerly to the place where they were, and
taking up each book, examined minutely what it was. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
author he complained was too light, another too depressing,
and put them on the shelves again: another was erroneous,
and he changed it for a better: thus, he warned her against
some, and selected other authors, as the most cautious preceptor
culls for his pupil, or a fond father for his darling
Child. She thanked him for his attention to her, but her
heart thanked him for his attention to his daughter. For
as she had herself never received such a proof of his care since
all their long acquaintance, she reasonably supposed, Matilda's
reading, and not hers, was the object of his solicitude.</p>

<p>Having in these books store of comfort for poor Matilda,
she eagerly returned with them; and in reciting every
particular circumstance, made her consider the volumes,
almost like presents from her father.</p>

<p>The month of September was now arrived; and Lord
Elmwood, accompanied by Rushbrook, went to a small
shooting seat, near twenty miles distant from Elmwood
Castle, for a week's particular sport. Matilda was once more
at large; and one beautiful morning, about eleven o'clock,
seeing Miss Woodley walking on the lawn before the house,
she hastily took her hat to join her; and not waiting to put
it on, went nimbly down the great staircase, with it hanging
on her arm. When she had descended a few stairs, she heard
a footstep walking slowly up; and, (from what emotion she
could not tell,) she stopped short, half resolved to turn back.
She hesitated a single instant whether she should or not&mdash;then
went a few steps further till she came to the second landing
place; when, by the sudden winding of the staircase,&mdash;Lord
Elmwood was immediately before her!</p>

<p>She had felt something like affright before she saw him;
but her reason told her she had nothing to fear, as he was
away. But now, the appearance of a stranger whom she had
never before seen; the authority in his looks, as well as in
the sound of his steps; a resemblance to the portrait she
had been shown of him; a start of astonishment which he
gave on beholding her; but above all&mdash;her <i>fears</i> confirmed
her that it was him. She gave a scream of terror&mdash;put out
her trembling hands to catch the balustrades for support&mdash;missed
them&mdash;and fell motionless into her father's arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught her, as by the same impulse, he would have
caught any other person falling for want of aid. Yet when
he found her in his arms, he still held her there&mdash;gazed on
her attentively&mdash;and once pressed her to his bosom.</p>

<p>At length trying to escape the snare into which he had
been led, he was going to leave her on the spot where she
fell, when her eyes opened and she uttered, "Save me."
Her voice unmanned him. His long-restrained tears now
burst forth&mdash;and seeing her relapsing into the swoon, he
cried out eagerly to recall her. Her name did not, however,
come to his recollection&mdash;nor any name but this&mdash;"Miss
Milner&mdash;Dear Miss Milner."</p>

<p>That sound did not awaken her; and now again he wished
to leave her in this senseless state, that not remembering what
had passed, she might escape the punishment.</p>

<p>But at this instant, Giffard, with another servant, passed
by the foot of the stairs: on which, Lord Elmwood called
to them&mdash;and into Giffard's hands delivered his apparently
dead child; without one command respecting her, or one
word of any kind; while his face was agitated with shame,
with pity, with anger, with paternal tenderness.</p>

<p>As Giffard stood trembling, while he relieved his Lord
from this hapless burthen, her father had to unloose her
hand from the side of his coat, which she had caught fast
hold of as she fell, and grasped so closely, it was with difficulty
released.&mdash;On attempting to take the hand away he trembled&mdash;faltered&mdash;then
bade Giffard do it.</p>

<p>"Who, I, my Lord! I separate you!" cried he. But
recollecting himself, "My Lord, I will obey your commands
whatever they are." And seizing her hand, pulled it with
violence&mdash;it fell&mdash;and her father went away.</p>

<p>Matilda was carried to her own apartments, laid upon the
bed, and Miss Woodley hasted to attend her, after listening
to the recital of what had passed.</p>

<p>When Lady Elmwood's old and affectionate friend entered
the room, and saw her youthful charge lying pale and speechless,
yet no father by to comfort or sooth her, she lifted up
her hands to Heaven exclaiming, with a burst of tears, "And
is this the end of thee, my poor child? Is this the end of all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
our hopes?&mdash;of thy own fearful hopes&mdash;and of thy mother's
supplications! Oh! Lord Elmwood! Lord Elmwood!"</p>

<p>At that name Matilda started, and cried, "Where is he?
Is it a dream, or have I seen him?"</p>

<p>"It is all a dream, my dear," said Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"And yet I thought he held me in his arms," she replied&mdash;"I
thought I felt his hands press mine.&mdash;Let me sleep and
dream again."</p>

<p>Now thinking it best to undeceive her, "It is no dream,
my dear," returned Miss Woodley.</p>

<p>"Is it not?" cried she, starting up and leaning on her
elbow&mdash;"Then I suppose I must go away&mdash;go for ever
away."</p>

<p>Sandford now entered. Having been told the news, he
came to condole&mdash;but at the sight of him Matilda was
terrified, and cried, "Do not reproach me, do not upbraid
me&mdash;I know I have done wrong&mdash;I know I had but one
command from my father, and that I have disobeyed."</p>

<p>Sandford could not reproach her, for he could not speak;
he therefore only walked to the window and concealed his
tears.</p>

<p>That whole day and night was passed in sympathetic grief,
in alarm at every sound, lest it should be a messenger to pronounce
Matilda's destiny.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood did not stay upon this visit above three
hours at Elmwood House; he then set off again for the seat
he had left; where Rushbrook still remained, and from
whence his Lordship had merely come by accident, to look
over some writings which he wanted dispatched to town.</p>

<p>During his short continuance here, Sandford cautiously
avoided his presence; for he thought, in a case like this, what
nature would not of herself effect, no art, no arguments of
his, could accomplish: to Nature and Providence he left
the whole. What these two powerful principles brought
about, the reader will judge, when he peruses the following
letter, received early the next morning by Miss Woodley.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>"My Lord, above a twelvemonth ago, acquainted me
he had permitted his daughter to reside in his house; but
at the same time he informed me, the grant was under
a certain restriction, which, if ever broken, I was to see his
then determination (of which he also acquainted me) put
in execution. In consequence of Lady Matilda's indisposition,
Madam, I have ventured to delay this notice till morning.&mdash;I
need not say with what concern I now give it, or mention
to you, I believe, what is forfeited. My Lord staid but a few
hours yesterday, after the unhappy circumstance on which
I write, took place; nor did I see him after, till he was in
his carriage; he then sent for me to the carriage door, and
told me he should be back in two days time, and added,
'Remember your duty.' That duty, I hope, Madam, you
will not require me to explain in more direct terms.&mdash;As soon
as my Lord returns, I have no doubt but he will ask me if
it is fulfilled, and I shall be under the greatest apprehension,
should his commands not be obeyed.</p>

<p>"If there is any thing wanting for the convenience of
your and Lady Matilda's departure, you have but to order
it, and it is at your service&mdash;I mean likewise any cash you
may have occasion for. I should presume to add my opinion
where you might best take up your abode; but with such
advice as you will have from Mr. Sandford, mine would be
but assuming.</p>

<p>"I would also have waited upon you, Madam, and have
delivered myself the substance of this letter; but I am an
old man, and the changes I have been witness to in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Lord's house since I first lived in it, has encreased my age
many years; and I have not the strength to see you upon
this occasion. I loved my deceased Lady&mdash;I love my Lord&mdash;and
I love their child&mdash;nay, so I am sure does my Lord
himself; but there is no accounting for his resolutions, or
for the alteration his disposition has lately undergone.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, Madam, for this long intrusion, and am,
and ever will be, (while you and my Lord's daughter are so)
your afflicted humble servant,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 22em;" class="smcap">"Robert Giffard.</span><br />
"Elmwood House,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Sept. 12."</span>
</div>

<p>When this letter was brought to Miss Woodley, she knew
what it contained before she opened it, and therefore took
it with an air of resignation&mdash;yet though she guessed the
momentous part of its contents, she dreaded in what words
it might be related; and having now no essential good to
expect, hope, that will never totally expire, clung at this
crisis to little circumstances, and she hoped most fervently,
the terms of the letter might not be harsh, but that Lord
Elmwood had delivered his commands in gentle language.
The event proved he had; and lost to every important
comfort, she felt grateful to him for this small one.</p>

<p>Matilda, too, was cheered by this letter, for she expected
something worse; and the last line, in which Giffard said he
knew "His Lordship loved her," she thought repaid her for
the purport of the other part.</p>

<p>Sandford was not so easily resigned or comforted&mdash;he
walked about the room when the letter was shewn to him&mdash;called
it cruel&mdash;stifled his tears, and wished to show his
resentment only&mdash;but the former burst through all his
endeavours, and he sunk into grief.</p>

<p>Nor was the fortitude of Matilda, which came to her
assistance on the first onset of this trial, sufficient to arm her,
when the moment came she was to quit the house&mdash;her
father's house&mdash;never to see that, or him again.</p>

<p>When word was brought that the carriage was at the door,
which was to convey her from all she held so dear, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
saw before her the prospect of a long youthful and healthful
life, in which misery and despair were all she could discern;
that despair seized her at once, and gaining courage from
it, she cried,</p>

<p>"What have I to fear if I disobey my father's commands
once more?&mdash;he cannot use me worse. I'll stay here till he
returns&mdash;again throw myself in his way, and then I will not
faint, but plead for mercy. Perhaps were I to kneel to him&mdash;kneel,
like other children to their parents, and beg his blessing,
he would not refuse it me."</p>

<p>"You must not try:" said Sandford, mildly.</p>

<p>"Who," cried she, "shall prevent me flying to my father?
Have I another friend on earth? Have I one relation in the
world but him? This is the second time I have been turned
out of his house. In my infant state my cruel father turned
me out; but then, he sent me to a mother&mdash;now I have
none; and I will stay with him."</p>

<p>Again the steward sent to let them know the coach was
waiting.</p>

<p>Sandford, now, with a determined countenance, went
coolly up to Lady Matilda, and taking her hand, seemed
resolved to lead her to the carriage.</p>

<p>Accustomed to be awed by every serious look of his, she
yet resisted this; and cried, "Would <i>you</i> be the minister of
my father's cruelty?"</p>

<p>"Then," said Sandford solemnly to her, "farewell&mdash;from
this moment you and I part. I will take my leave, and do
you remain where you are&mdash;at least till you are forced away.
But I'll not stay to be driven hence&mdash;for it is impossible
your father will suffer any friend of yours to continue here,
after this disobedience. Adieu."</p>

<p>"I'll go this moment," said she, and rose hastily.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley took her at her word, and hurried her
immediately out of the room.</p>

<p>Sandford followed slow behind, as if he had followed at
her funeral.</p>

<p>When she came to that spot on the stairs where she had
met her father, she started back, and scarce knew how to
pass it. When she had&mdash;"There he held me in his arms,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
said she, "and I thought I felt him press me to his heart,
but I now find I was mistaken."</p>

<p>As Sandford came forward, to hand her into the coach,
"Now you behave well;" said he, "by this behaviour, you
do not entirely close all prospect of reconciliation with your
father."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is not yet impossible?" cried she,
clasping his hand. "Giffard says he loves me," continued
she, "and do you think he might yet be brought to forgive
me?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you!" cried Sandford.</p>

<p>"Suppose I was to write to him, and entreat his forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"Do not write yet," said Sandford, with no cheering
accent.</p>

<p>The carriage drove off&mdash;and as it went, Matilda leaned
her head from the window, to survey Elmwood House from
the roof to the bottom. She cast her eyes upon the gardens
too&mdash;upon the fish ponds&mdash;even the coach houses, and all the
offices adjoining&mdash;which, as objects that she should never
see again&mdash;she contemplated, as objects of importance.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Rushbrook, who, at twenty miles distance, could have no
conjecture what had passed at Elmwood House, during the
short visit Lord Elmwood made there, went that way with
his dogs and gun in order to meet him on his return, and
accompany him in the chaise back&mdash;he did so&mdash;and getting
into the carriage, told him eagerly the sport he had had
during the day; laughed at an accident that had befallen
one of his dogs; and for some time did not perceive but
that his uncle was perfectly attentive. At length, observing
he answered more negligently than usual to what he said,
Rushbrook turned his eyes quickly upon him, and cried,</p>

<p>"My Lord, are you not well?"</p>

<p>"Yes; perfectly well, I thank you, Rushbrook," and he
leaned back against the carriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought, Sir," returned Rushbrook, "you spoke
languidly&mdash;I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"I have the head-ache a little," answered he:&mdash;then taking
off his hat, brushed the powder from it, and as he put it on
again, fetched a most heavy sigh; which no sooner had
escaped him, than, to drown its sound, he said briskly,</p>

<p>"And so you tell me you have had good sport to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, I said but indifferent."</p>

<p>"True, so you did. Bid the man drive faster&mdash;it will be
dark before we get home."</p>

<p>"You will shoot to-morrow, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"How does Mr. Sandford do, Sir?"</p>

<p>"I did not see him."</p>

<p>"Not see Mr. Sandford, My Lord? but he was out
I suppose&mdash;for they did not expect you at Elmwood House."</p>

<p>"No, they did not."</p>

<p>In such conversation Rushbrook and his uncle continued
to the end of their journey. Dinner was then immediately
served, and Lord Elmwood appeared much in his usual
spirits; at least, not suspecting any cause for their abatement,
Rushbrook did not observe any alteration.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood went, however, earlier to bed than ordinary,
or rather to his bed-chamber; for though he retired some
time before his nephew, when Rushbrook passed his chamber
door it was open, and he not in bed, but sitting in a musing
posture, as if he had forgot to shut it.</p>

<p>When Rushbrook's valet came to attend his master, he
said to him,</p>

<p>"I suppose, Sir, you do not know what has happened at
the Castle?"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake what?" cried Rushbrook.</p>

<p>"My Lord has met Lady Matilda:" replied the man.</p>

<p>"How? Where? What's the consequence?"</p>

<p>"We don't know yet, Sir; but all the servants suppose
her Ladyship will not be suffered to remain there any
longer."</p>

<p>"They all suppose wrong," returned Rushbrook hastily&mdash;"My
Lord loves her I am certain, and this event may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the happy means of his treating her as his child from this
day."</p>

<p>The servant smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Why, what more do you know?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than I have told you, Sir; except that
his Lordship took no kind of notice of her Ladyship that
appeared like love."</p>

<p>Rushbrook was all uneasiness and anxiety to know the
particulars of what had passed; and now Lord Elmwood's
inquietude, which he had but slightly noticed before, came
full to his observation. He was going to ask more questions;
but he recollected Lady Matilda's misfortunes were too
sacred, to be talked of thus familiarly by the servants of the
family;&mdash;besides, it was evident this man thought, and but
naturally, it might not be for his master's interest the father
and the daughter should be united; and therefore would
certainly give to all he said the opposite colouring.</p>

<p>In spite of his prudence, however, and his delicacy towards
Matilda, Rushbrook could not let his valet leave him till he
had inquired, and learned all the circumstantial account of
what had happened; except, indeed, the order received by
Giffard, which being given after Lord Elmwood was in his
carriage and in concise terms, the domestics who attended
him (and from whom this man had gained his intelligence)
were unacquainted with it.</p>

<p>When the servant had left Rushbrook alone, the perturbation
of his mind was so great, that he was, at length, undetermined
whether to go to bed, or to rush into his uncle's apartment,
and at his feet beg for that compassion upon his
daughter, which he feared he had denied her. But then, to
what peril would he not expose himself by such a step?
Nay, he might perhaps even injure her whom he wished to
serve; for if his uncle was at present unresolved, whether to
forgive or to resent this disobedience to his commands,
another's interference might enrage, and precipitate him on
the latter.</p>

<p>This consideration was so weighty, it resigned Rushbrook
to the suspense he was compelled to endure till the morning;
when he flattered himself, that by watching every look and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
motion of Lord Elmwood, his penetration would be able to
discover the state of his heart, and how he meant to act.</p>

<p>But the morning came, and he found all his prying curiosity
was of no avail; Lord Elmwood did not drop one word,
give one look, or use one action that was not customary.</p>

<p>On first seeing him, Rushbrook blushed at the secret with
which he was entrusted; then, as he gazed on the Earl, contemplated
the joy he ought to have known in clasping in
his arms a child like Matilda, whose tenderness, reverence,
and duty, had deprived her of all sensation at his sight;
which was in Rushbrook's mind an honour, that rendered
him superior to what he was before.</p>

<p>They were in the fields all the day as usual; Lord Elmwood
now cheerful, and complaining no more of the head-ache.
Yet once being separated from his nephew, Rushbrook crossed
over a stile into another field, and found him sitting by the
side of a bank, his gun lying by him, and himself lost in
thought. He rose on seeing him, and proceeded to the sport
as before.</p>

<p>At dinner, he said he should not go to Elmwood House
the next day, as he had appointed, but stay where he was,
three or four days longer. From these two small occurrences,
Rushbrook would fain have extracted something by which
to judge the state of his mind; but upon the test, that was
impossible&mdash;he had caught him so musing many a time
before; and as to his prolonging his stay, that might arise
from the sport&mdash;or, indeed, had any thing more material
swayed him, who could penetrate whether it was the effect
of the lenity, or the severity, he had dealt towards his child?
whether his continuance there was to shun her, or to shun
the house from whence he had banished her?</p>

<p>The three or four days for their temporary abode being
passed, they both returned together to Elmwood House.
Rushbrook thought he saw his uncle's countenance change
as they entered the avenue, yet he did not appear less in
spirits; and when Sandford joined them at dinner, the Earl
went with his usual alacrity to him, and (as was his custom
after any separation) put out his hand cheerfully to take his.
Sandford said, "How do you do, my Lord?" cheerfully in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
return; but put both his hands into his bosom, and walked
to the other side of the room. Lord Elmwood did not seem
to observe this affront&mdash;nor was it done as an affront&mdash;it
was merely what poor Sandford felt; and he felt he could
<i>not</i> shake hands with him.</p>

<p>Rushbrook soon learned the news that Matilda was gone,
and Elmwood House was to him a desert&mdash;he saw there no
real friend of her's, except poor Sandford, and to him, Rushbrook
knew himself now, more displeasing than ever; and
all his overtures of atonement, he, at this time, found more
and more ineffectual. Matilda was exiled; and her supposed
triumphant rival was, to Sandford, more odious than he had
ever been.</p>

<p>In alleviation of their banishment, Miss Woodley, with
her charge, had not returned to their old retreat; but were
gone to a farm house, not farther than thirty miles from
Lord Elmwood's: here Sandford, with little inconvenience,
visited them; nor did his patron ever take notice of his
occasional absence; for as he had before given his daughter,
in some measure, to his charge; so honour, delicacy, and the
common ties of duty, made him approve, rather than condemn
his attention to her.</p>

<p>Though Sandford's frequent visits soothed Matilda, they
could not comfort her; for he had no consolation to bestow
that was suited to her mind&mdash;her father had given no one
token of regret for what he had done. He had even inquired
sternly of Giffard on his returning home,</p>

<p>"If Miss Woodley had left the house?"</p>

<p>The steward guessing the whole of his meaning, answered,
"Yes, my Lord; and <i>all</i> your commands in that respect
have been obeyed."</p>

<p>He replied, "I am satisfied." And, to the grief of the old
man, appeared really so.</p>

<p>To the farm-house, the place of Matilda's residence, there
came, besides Sandford, another visitor far less welcome&mdash;Viscount
Margrave. He had heard with surprise, and still
greater joy, that Lord Elmwood had once more shut his doors
against his daughter. In this her discarded state, he no
longer burthened his lively imagination with the dull thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
of marriage, but once more formed the idea of making her
his mistress.</p>

<p>Ignorant of a certain decorum which attended all Lord
Elmwood's actions, he suspected that his child might be in
want; and an acquaintance with the worst part of her sex
informed him, that relief from poverty was the sure bargain
for his success. With these hopes, he again paid Miss Woodley
and her a visit; but the coldness of the former, and the
haughtiness of the latter, still kept him at a distance, and
again made him fear to give one allusion to his purpose: but
he returned home resolved to write what he durst not speak&mdash;he
did so&mdash;he offered his services, his purse, his house&mdash;they
were rejected with contempt, and a stronger prohibition
than ever given to his visits.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood had now allowed Rushbrook a long
vacation, in respect to his answer upon the subject of
marriage; and the young man vainly imagined, his intentions
upon that subject were entirely given up. One morning,
however, as he was attending him in the library,</p>

<p>"Henry,"&mdash;&mdash;said his uncle, with a pause at the beginning
of his speech, which indicated that he was going to say
something of importance, "Henry&mdash;&mdash;you have not forgot
the discourse I had with you a little time previous to your
illness?"</p>

<p>Henry hesitated&mdash;for he wished to have forgotten it&mdash;but
it was too strongly impressed upon his memory. Lord Elmwood
resumed,</p>

<p>"What! equivocating again, Sir? Do you remember it,
or do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord, I do."</p>

<p>"And are you prepared to give me an answer?"</p>

<p>Rushbrook paused again.</p>

<p>"In our former conversation," continued the Earl, "I gave
you but a week to determine&mdash;there has, I think, elapsed
since that time, half a year."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"About as much, Sir."</p>

<p>"Then surely you have now made up your mind?"</p>

<p>"I had done that at first, my Lord&mdash;if it had met with
your concurrence."</p>

<p>"You wished to lead a bachelor's life, I think you said?"</p>

<p>Rushbrook bowed.</p>

<p>"Contrary to my will?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, I wished to have your approbation."</p>

<p>"And you wished for my approbation of the very opposite
thing to that I proposed? But I am not surprised&mdash;such is
the gratitude of the world&mdash;and such is yours."</p>

<p>"My Lord, if you doubt my gratitude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give me a proof of it, Harry, and I will doubt no longer."</p>

<p>"Upon every other subject but this, my Lord, Heaven
is my witness your happiness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood interrupted him. "I understand you&mdash;upon
every other subject, but the only one, my content
requires, you are ready to obey me. I thank you."</p>

<p>"My Lord, do not torture me with this suspicion; it is
so contrary to my deserts, that I cannot bear it."</p>

<p>"Suspicion of your ingratitude!&mdash;you judge too favourably
of my opinion&mdash;it amounts to certainty."</p>

<p>"Then to convince you, Sir, I am not ungrateful, tell me
who the Lady is you have chosen for me, and here I give
you my word, I will sacrifice all my future prospects of
happiness&mdash;all, for which I would wish to live&mdash;and become
her husband as soon as you shall appoint."</p>

<p>This was spoken with a tone so expressive of despair, that
Lord Elmwood replied,</p>

<p>"And while you obey me, you take care to let me know,
it will cost you your future peace. This is, I suppose, to
enhance the merit of the obligation&mdash;but I shall not accept
your acquiescence on these terms."</p>

<p>"Then in dispensing with it, I hope for your pardon."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, Rushbrook, I can pardon an offence,
the sole foundation of which, arises from a spirit of disobedience?&mdash;for
you have declared to me your affections are
disengaged. In our last conversation did you not say so?"</p>

<p>"At first I did, my Lord&mdash;but you permitted me to con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>sult
my heart more closely; and I have since found that
I was mistaken."</p>

<p>"You then own you at first told me a falsehood, and yet
have all this time, kept me in suspense without confessing it."</p>

<p>"I waited, my Lord, till you should enquire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have then, Sir, waited too long;" and the fire
flashed from his eyes.</p>

<p>Rushbrook now found himself in that perilous state, that
admitted of no medium of resentment, but by such dastardly
conduct on his part, as would wound both his truth and
courage; and thus, animated by his danger, he was resolved
to plunge boldly at once into the depth of his patron's anger.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said he, (but he did not undertake this task
without sustaining the trembling and convulsion of his whole
frame) "My Lord&mdash;waving for a moment the subject of my
marriage&mdash;permit me to remind you, that when I was upon
my sick bed, you promised, that on my recovery, you would
listen to a petition I should offer to you."</p>

<p>"Let me recollect," replied he. "Yes&mdash;I do remember
something of it. But I said nothing to warrant any improper
petition."</p>

<p>"Its impropriety was not named, my Lord."</p>

<p>"No matter&mdash;that, you must judge of, and answer for the
consequences."</p>

<p>"I would answer with my life, willingly&mdash;but I own that
I shrink from your anger."</p>

<p>"Then do not provoke it."</p>

<p>"I have already gone too far to recede&mdash;and you would
of course demand an explanation, if I attempted to stop
here."</p>

<p>"I should."</p>

<p>"Then, my Lord, I am bound to speak&mdash;but do not interrupt
me&mdash;hear me out, before you banish me from your
presence for ever."</p>

<p>"I will, Sir," replied he, prepared to hear something that
would displease him, and yet determined to hear with
patience to the conclusion.</p>

<p>"Then, my Lord,"&mdash;(cried Rushbrook, in the greatest
agitation of mind and body) "Your daughter"&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The resolution Lord Elmwood had taken (and on which
he had given his word to his nephew not to interrupt him)
immediately gave way. The colour rose in his face&mdash;his eye
darted lightning&mdash;and his hand was lifted up with the
emotion, that word had created.</p>

<p>"You promised to hear me, my Lord!" cried Rushbrook,
"and I claim your promise."</p>

<p>He now suddenly overcame his violence of passion, and
stood silent and resigned to hear him; but with a determined
look, expressive of the vengeance that should ensue.</p>

<p>"Lady Matilda," resumed Rushbrook, "is an object that
wrests from me the enjoyment of every blessing your kindness
bestows. I cannot but feel myself as her adversary&mdash;as one,
who has supplanted her in your affections&mdash;who supplies her
place, while she is exiled, a wanderer, and an orphan."</p>

<p>The Earl took his eyes from Rushbrook, during this last
sentence, and cast them on the floor.</p>

<p>"If I feel gratitude towards you, my Lord," continued he,
"gratitude is innate in my heart, and I must also feel it
towards her, who first introduced me to your protection."</p>

<p>Again the colour flew to Lord Elmwood's face; and again
he could hardly restrain himself from uttering his indignation.</p>

<p>"It was the mother of Lady Matilda," continued Rushbrook,
"who was this friend to me; nor will I ever think of
marriage, or any other joyful prospect, while you abandon
the only child of my beloved patroness, and load me with
rights, which belong to her."</p>

<p>Here Rushbrook stopped&mdash;Lord Elmwood was silent too,
for near half a minute; but still his countenance continued
fixed, with his unvaried resolves.</p>

<p>After this long pause, the Earl said with composure, but
with firmness, "Have you finished, Mr. Rushbrook?"</p>

<p>"All that I dare to utter, my Lord; and I fear, I have
already said too much."</p>

<p>Rushbrook now trembled more than ever, and looked pale
as death; for the ardour of speaking being over, he waited
his sentence, with less constancy of mind than he expected
he should.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"You disapprove my conduct, it seems;" said Lord
Elmwood, "and in that, you are but like the rest of the
world&mdash;and yet, among all my acquaintance, you are the only
one who has dared to insult me with your opinion. And this
you have not done inadvertently; but willingly, and deliberately.
But as it has been my fate to be used ill, and severed
from all those persons to whom my soul has been most
attached; with less regret I can part from you, than if this
were my first trial."</p>

<p>There was a truth and a pathetic sound in the utterance of
these words, that struck Rushbrook to the heart&mdash;and he
beheld himself as a barbarian, who had treated his benevolent
and only friend, with insufferable liberty; void of respect
for those corroding sorrows which had imbittered so many
years of his life, and in open violation of his most peremptory
commands. He felt that he deserved all he was going to
suffer, and he fell upon his knees; not so much to deprecate
the doom he saw impending, as thus humbly to acknowledge,
it was his due.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood, irritated by this posture, as a sign of the
presumptuous hope that he might be forgiven, suffered now
his anger to burst all bounds; and raising his voice, he
exclaimed in a rage,</p>

<p>"Leave my house, Sir. Leave my house instantly, and
seek some other home."</p>

<p>Just as these words were begun, Sandford opened the
library door, was witness to them, and to the imploring
situation of Rushbrook. He stood silent with amazement!</p>

<p>Rushbrook arose, and feeling in his mind a presage, that
he might never from that hour, behold his benefactor more;
as he bowed in token of obedience to his commands, a shower
of tears covered his face; but Lord Elmwood, unmoved,
fixed his eyes upon him, which pursued him with enraged
looks to the end of the room. Here he had to pass Sandford;
who, for the first time in his life, took hold of him by the
hand, and said to Lord Elmwood, "My Lord, what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"That ungrateful villain," cried he, "has dared to insult
me.&mdash;Leave my house this moment, Sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Rushbrook made an effort to go, but Sandford still held
his hand; and meekly said to Lord Elmwood,</p>

<p>"He is but a boy, my Lord, and do not give him the
punishment of a man."</p>

<p>Rushbrook now snatched his hand from Sandford's, and
threw it with himself upon his neck; where he indeed
sobbed like a boy.</p>

<p>"You are both in league," exclaimed Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"Do you suspect me of partiality to Mr. Rushbrook?" said
Sandford, advancing nearer to the Earl.</p>

<p>Rushbrook had now gained the point of remaining in the
room; but the hope that privilege inspired (while he still
harboured all the just apprehensions for his fate) gave birth,
perhaps, to a more exquisite sensation of pain, than despair
would have done. He stood silent&mdash;confounded&mdash;hoping
that he was forgiven&mdash;fearing that he was not.</p>

<p>As Sandford approached still nearer to Lord Elmwood, he
continued, "No, my Lord, I know you do not suspect me,
of partiality to Mr. Rushbrook&mdash;has any part of my behaviour
ever discovered it?"</p>

<p>"You now then only interfere to provoke me."</p>

<p>"If that were the case," returned Sandford, "there have
been occasions, when I might have done it more effectually&mdash;when
my own heart-strings were breaking, because I would
not provoke, or add to what you suffered."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, Mr. Sandford:" he returned, mildly.</p>

<p>"And if, my Lord, I have proved any merit in a late forbearance,
reward me for it now; and take this young man
from the depth of despair in which I see he is sunk, and say
you pardon him."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood made no answer&mdash;and Rushbrook, drawing
strong inferences of hope from his silence, lifted up his eyes
from the ground, and ventured to look in his face: he found
it composed to what it had been, but still strongly marked
with agitation. He cast his eyes away again, in confusion.</p>

<p>On which his uncle said to him&mdash;"I shall postpone executing
your obedience to my late orders, till you think fit once
more to provoke them&mdash;and then, not even Sandford, shall
dare to plead your excuse."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Rushbrook bowed.</p>

<p>"Go, leave the room, Sir."</p>

<p>He instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>Then Sandford, turning to Lord Elmwood, shook him by
the hand, and cried, "My Lord, I thank you&mdash;I thank you
very kindly, my Lord&mdash;I shall now begin to think I have
some weight with you."</p>

<p>"You might indeed think so, did you know how much
I have pardoned."</p>

<p>"What was his offence, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"Such as I would not have forgiven you, or any earthly
being besides himself&mdash;but while you were speaking in his
behalf, I recollected there was a gratitude so extraordinary
in the hazards he ran, that almost made him pardonable."</p>

<p>"I guess the subject then," cried Sandford; and yet
I could not have supposed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a subject we cannot speak on, Sandford, therefore
let us drop it."</p>

<p>At these words the discourse concluded.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>To the relief of Rushbrook, Lord Elmwood that day dined
from home, and he had not the confusion to see him again
till the evening. Previous to this, Sandford and he met at
dinner; but as the attendants were present, nothing passed
on either side respecting the incident in the morning.
Rushbrook, from the peril which had so lately threatened
him, was now in his perfectly cool, and dispassionate senses;
and notwithstanding the real tenderness which he bore to
the daughter of his benefactor, he was not insensible to the
comfort of finding himself, once more in the possession of all
those enjoyments he had forfeited, and for a moment lost.</p>

<p>As he reflected on this, to Sandford he felt the first tie of
acknowledgement&mdash;but for his compassion, he knew he should
have been at that very time of their meeting at dinner, away
from Elmwood House for ever; and bearing on his mind
a still more painful recollection, the burthen of his kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
patron's continual displeasure. Filled with these thoughts,
all the time of dinner, he could scarce look at his companion,
without tears of gratitude; and whenever he attempted to
speak to him, gratitude choaked his utterance.</p>

<p>Sandford, on his part, behaved just the same as ever; and
to show he did not wish to remind Rushbrook of what he had
done, he was just as uncivil as ever.</p>

<p>Among other things, he said, "He did not know Lord
Elmwood dined from home, for if he had, he should have
dined in his own apartment."</p>

<p>Rushbrook was still more obliged to him for all this; and
the weight of obligations with which he was oppressed,
made him long for an opportunity to relieve himself by
expressions. As soon, therefore, as the servants were all
withdrawn, he began:</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandford, whatever has been your opinion of <i>me</i>,
I take pride to myself, that in my sentiments towards <i>you</i>,
I have always distinguished you for that humane, disinterested
character, you have this day proved."</p>

<p>"Humane, and disinterested," replied Sandford, "are
flattering epithets indeed, for an old man going out of the
world, and who can have no temptation to be otherwise."</p>

<p>"Then suffer me to call your actions generous and compassionate,
for they have saved me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, young man," cried Sandford, interrupting him,
"you are glad at what I have done, and that you find a gratification
in telling me you are; but it is a gratification I will
not indulge you with&mdash;therefore, say another sentence on
the subject, and" (rising from his seat) "I'll leave the room,
and never come into your company again, whatever your
uncle may say to it."</p>

<p>Rushbrook saw by the solemnity of his countenance, he
was serious, and positively assured him he would never thank
him more: on which Sandford took his seat again, but he
still frowned, and it was many minutes before he conquered
his ill humour. As his countenance became less sour, Rushbrook
fell from some general topics he had eagerly started
in order to appease him, and said,</p>

<p>"How hard is it to restrain conversation from the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of our thoughts; and yet amidst our dearest friends, and
among persons who have the same dispositions and sentiments
as our own, their minds, too, fixed upon the self-same objects,
is this constraint practised&mdash;and thus, society, which was
meant for one of our greatest blessings, becomes insipid, nay,
often more wearisome than solitude."</p>

<p>"I think, young man," replied Sandford, "you have made
pretty free with your speech to-day, and ought not to complain
of the want of toleration on that score."</p>

<p>"I do complain;" replied Rushbrook, "for if toleration
was more frequent, the favour of obtaining it would be less."</p>

<p>"And your pride, I suppose, is above receiving a favour."</p>

<p>"Never from those I esteem; and to convince you of it,
I wish this moment to request a favour of you."</p>

<p>"I dare say I shall refuse it. However what is it?"</p>

<p>"Permit me to speak to you upon the subject of Lady
Matilda?"</p>

<p>Sandford made no answer, consequently did not forbid
him&mdash;and he proceeded.</p>

<p>"For her sake&mdash;as I suppose Lord Elmwood may have
told you&mdash;I this morning rashly threw myself into the predicament
from whence you released me&mdash;for her sake, I have
suffered much&mdash;for her sake I have hazarded a great deal,
and am still ready to hazard more."</p>

<p>"But for your own sake, do not," returned Sandford,
drily.</p>

<p>"You may laugh at these sentiments as romantic, Mr. Sandford,
but if they are, to me they are nevertheless natural."</p>

<p>"But of what service are they to be either to her, or to
yourself?"</p>

<p>"To me they are painful, and to her would be but impertinent,
were she to know them."</p>

<p>"I shan't inform her of them, so do not trouble yourself
to caution me against it."</p>

<p>"I was not going&mdash;you know I was not&mdash;but I was going
to say, that from no one so well as from you, could she be told
my sentiments, without the danger of receiving offence."</p>

<p>"And what impression do you wish to give her, from her
becoming acquainted with them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"The impression, that she has one sincere friend: that
upon every occurrence in life, there is a heart so devoted
to all she feels, that she never can suffer without the sympathy
of another: or can ever command him, and all his fortunes
to unite for her welfare, without his ready, his immediate
compliance."</p>

<p>"And do you imagine, that any of your professions, or
any of her necessities, would ever prevail upon her to put
you to the trial?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"What, then, are the motives which induce you to wish
her to be told of this?"</p>

<p>Rushbrook paused.</p>

<p>"Do you think," continued Sandford, "the intelligence
will give her any satisfaction?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"Will it be of any to yourself?"</p>

<p>"The highest in the world."</p>

<p>"And so all you have been urging upon this occasion, is,
at last, only to please yourself."</p>

<p>"You wrong my meaning&mdash;it is her merit which inspires
me with the desire of being known to her&mdash;it is her sufferings,
her innocence, her beauty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sandford stared&mdash;Rushbrook proceeded: "It is her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, stop where you are," cried Sandford; "you are
arrived at the zenith of perfection in a woman, and to add
one qualification more, would be an anti-climax."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Rushbrook with warmth, "I loved her,
before I ever beheld her."</p>

<p>"Loved her!" cried Sandford, with astonishment, "You
are talking of what you did not intend."</p>

<p>"I am, indeed:" returned he in confusion, "I fell by
accident on the word love."</p>

<p>"And by the same accident stumbled on the word beauty;
and thus by accident, am I come to the truth of all your
professions."</p>

<p>Rushbrook knew that he loved; and though his affection
had sprung from the most laudable motives, yet was he
ashamed of it, as of a vice&mdash;he rose, he walked about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
room, and he did not look Sandford in the face for a quarter
of an hour: Sandford, satisfied that he had judged rightly,
and yet unwilling to be too hard upon a passion, which he
readily believed must have had many noble virtues for its
foundation, now got up and went away, without saying
a word in censure, though not a word in approbation.</p>

<p>It was in the month of October, and just dark, at the time
Rushbrook was left alone, yet in the agitation of his mind,
arising from the subject on which he had been talking, he
found it impossible to remain in the house, and therefore
walked into the fields; but there was another instigation,
more powerful than the necessity of walking&mdash;it was the
allurement of passing along that path where he had last seen
Lady Matilda, and where, for the only time, she had condescended
to speak to him divested of haughtiness; and with
a gentleness that dwelt upon his memory beyond all her other
endowments.</p>

<p>Here, he retraced his own steps repeatedly, his whole
imagination engrossed with her idea, till the sound of her
father's carriage returning from his visit, roused him from
the delusion of his trance, to the dread of the confusion and
embarrassment he should endure, on next meeting him. He
hoped Sandford might be present, and yet he was now, almost
as much ashamed of seeing him, as his uncle, whom he had
so lately offended.</p>

<p>Loath to leave the spot where he was, as to enter the house,
he remained there, till he considered it would be ill manners,
in his present humiliated situation, not to show himself at
the usual supper hour, which was immediately.</p>

<p>As he laid his hand upon the door of the apartment to
open it, he was sorry to hear by Lord Elmwood's voice, he
was in the room before him; for there was something much
more conspicuously distressing, in entering where he already
was, than had his uncle come in after him. He found himself,
however, re-assured, by overhearing the Earl laugh and speak
in a tone expressive of the utmost good humour to Sandford,
who was with him.</p>

<p>Yet again, he felt all the awkwardness of his own situation;
but making one courageous effort, opened the door and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
entered. Lord Elmwood had been away half the day, had
dined abroad, and it was necessary to take some notice of
his return; Rushbrook, therefore, bowed humbly, and what
was more to his advantage, he looked humbly. His uncle
made a slight return to the salutation, but continued the
recital he had begun to Sandford; then sat down to the
supper table&mdash;supped&mdash;and passed the whole evening without
saying a syllable, or even casting a look, in remembrance
of what had passed in the morning. Or if there was any
token, that shewed he remembered the circumstance at all,
it was the putting his glass to his nephew's, when Rushbrook
called for wine, and drinking at the time he did.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The repulse Lord Margrave received, did not diminish
the ardour of his pursuit; for as he was no longer afraid of
resentment from the Earl, whatever treatment his daughter
might receive, he was determined the anger of Lady Matilda,
or of her female friend, should not impede his pretensions.</p>

<p>Having taken this resolution, he laid the plan of an open
violation of all right; and determined to bear away that
prize by force, which no art was likely to procure. He concerted
with two of his favourite companions, but their advice
was, "One struggle more of fair means." This was totally
against his inclination; for, he had much rather have
encountered the piercing cries of a female in the last agonies
of distress, than the fatigue of her sentimental harangues,
or elegant reproofs, such as he had the sense to understand,
but not the capacity to answer.</p>

<p>Stimulated, however, by his friends to one more trial, in
spite of the formal dismission he had twice received, he intruded
another visit on Lady Matilda at the Farm. Provoked
beyond bearing at such unfeeling assurance, Matilda
refused to come into the room where he was, and Miss Woodley
alone received him, and expressed her surprise at the little
attention he had paid to her explicit desire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madam," replied the nobleman, "to be plain with you,
I am in love."</p>

<p>"I do not the least doubt it, my Lord," replied Miss
Woodley: "nor ought you to doubt the truth of what
I advance, when I assure you, that you have not the smallest
reason to hope your love will be returned; for Lady Matilda
is resolved <i>never</i> to listen to your passion."</p>

<p>"That man," he replied, "is to blame, who can relinquish
his hopes, upon the mere resolution of a lady."</p>

<p>"And that lady would be wrong," replied Miss Woodley,
"who should entrust her happiness in the care of a man,
who can think thus meanly of her and of her sex."</p>

<p>"I think highly of them all," he replied; "and to convince
you in how high an estimation I hold <i>her</i> in particular, my
whole fortune is at her command."</p>

<p>"Your entire absence from this house, my Lord, she would
consider as a much greater mark of your respect."</p>

<p>A long conversation, as uninteresting as this, ensued: the
unexpected arrival of Mr. Sandford, put an end to it. He
started at the sight of Lord Margrave; but the Viscount
was much more affected at the sight of him.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Sandford boldly to him, "have you
received any encouragement from Lady Matilda to authorize
this visit?"</p>

<p>"None, upon my honour, Mr. Sandford; but I hope you
know how to pardon a lover!"</p>

<p>"A rational one I do&mdash;but you, my Lord, are not of that
class while you persecute the pretended object of your
affection."</p>

<p>"Do you call it persecution that I once offered her a share
of my title and fortune&mdash;and even now, declare my fortune
is at her disposal?"</p>

<p>Sandford was uncertain whether he understood his meaning&mdash;but
Lord Margrave, provoked at his ill reception,
felt a triumph in removing his doubts, and proceeded
thus:</p>

<p>"For the discarded daughter of Lord Elmwood, cannot
expect the same proposals, which I made, while she was
acknowledged, and under the protection of her father."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"What proposals then, my Lord?" asked Sandford
hastily.</p>

<p>"Such," replied he, "as the Duke of Avon made to her
mother."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley quitted the room that instant. But Sandford,
who never felt resentment but against those in whom
he saw some virtue, calmly replied,</p>

<p>"My Lord, the Duke of Avon was a gentleman, a man of
elegance and breeding; and what have you to offer in
recompense for your defects in qualities like these?"</p>

<p>"My wealth," replied he, "opposed to her indigence."
Sandford smiled, and answered,</p>

<p>"Do you suppose <i>that</i> wealth can be esteemed, which has
not been able to make you respectable? What is it makes
wealth valuable? Is it the pleasures of the table? the
pleasure of living in a fine house? or of wearing fine cloaths?
These are pleasures, a Lord enjoys, but in common with his
valet. It is the pleasure of being conspicuous, which makes
riches desirable; but if we are conspicuous only for our vice
and folly, had we not better remain in poverty?"</p>

<p>"You are beneath my notice."</p>

<p>"I trust I shall continue so&mdash;and that your Lordship will
never again condescend to come where I am."</p>

<p>"A man of rank condescends to mix with any society,
when a pretty woman is the object."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I have a book here in my pocket, which I am
eager to read; it is an author who speaks sense and reason&mdash;will
you pardon the impatience I feel for such company; and
permit me to call your carriage?"</p>

<p>Saying this, he went hastily and beckoned to the coachman;
the carriage drove up, the door was opened, and Lord
Margrave, ashamed to be exposed before his attendants, and
convinced of the inutility of remaining any longer where he
was, departed.</p>

<p>Sandford was soon joined by the ladies; and the conversation
falling, of course, upon the nobleman who had just
taken his leave, Sandford unwarily exclaimed, "I wish
Rushbrook had been here."</p>

<p>"Who?" cried Lady Matilda.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do believe," said Miss Woodley, "that young man
has some good qualities."</p>

<p>"A great many," returned Sandford, mutteringly.</p>

<p>"Happy young man!" cried Matilda: "he is beloved
by all those, whose affection it would be my choice to possess,
beyond any other blessing this world could bestow."</p>

<p>"And yet I question, if Rushbrook is happy," said Sandford.</p>

<p>"He cannot be otherwise," returned Matilda, "if he is
a man of understanding."</p>

<p>"He does not want understanding neither," replied
Sandford; "although he has certainly many indiscretions."</p>

<p>"But which Lord Elmwood, I suppose," said Matilda,
"looks upon with tenderness."</p>

<p>"Not upon all his faults," answered Sandford; "for
I have seen him in very dangerous circumstances with your
father."</p>

<p>"Have you indeed?" cried Matilda: "then I pity
him."</p>

<p>"And I believe," said Miss Woodley, "that from his heart,
he compassionates you. Now, Mr. Sandford," continued she,
"though this is the first time I ever heard you speak in his
favour, (and I once thought as indifferently of Mr. Rushbrook
as you can do) yet now I will venture to ask you,
whether you do not think he wishes Lady Matilda much
happier than she is?"</p>

<p>"I have heard him say so," answered Sandford.</p>

<p>"It is a subject," returned Lady Matilda, "which I did
not imagine you, Mr. Sandford, would have permitted him
to have mentioned lightly, in your presence."</p>

<p>"Lightly! Do you suppose, my dear, we turned your
situation into ridicule?"</p>

<p>"No, Sir,&mdash;but there is a sort of humiliation in the grief
to which I am doomed, that ought surely to be treated with
the highest degree of delicacy by my friends."</p>

<p>"I don't know on what point you fix real delicacy; but
if it consists in sorrow, the young man gives a proof he
possesses it, for he shed tears when I last heard him mention
your name."</p>

<p>"I have more cause to weep at the mention of his."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps so.&mdash;But let me tell you, Lady Matilda, that your
father might have preferred a more unworthy object."</p>

<p>"Still had he been to me," she cried, "an object of envy.
And as I frankly confess my envy of Mr. Rushbrook, I hope
you will pardon my malice, which is, you know, but a consequent
crime."</p>

<p>The subject now turned again upon Lord Margrave; and
all of them being firmly persuaded, this last reception would
put an end to every further intrusion from him, they treated
his pretensions, and himself, with the contempt they inspired&mdash;but
not with the caution that was requisite.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The next morning early, Mr. Sandford returned to Elmwood
House, but with his spirits depressed, and his heart
overcharged with sorrow. He had seen Lady Matilda, the
object of his visit, but he had beheld her considerably altered
in her looks and in her health; she was become very thin,
and instead of the vivid bloom that used to adorn her cheeks,
her whole complexion was of a deadly pale&mdash;her countenance
no longer expressed hope or fear, but a fixed melancholy&mdash;she
shed no tears, but was all sadness. He had beheld this,
and he had heard her insulted by the licentious proposals
of a nobleman, from whom there was no satisfaction to be
demanded, because she had no friend to vindicate her honour.</p>

<p>Rushbrook, who suspected where Sandford was gone, and
imagined he would return that day, took his morning's ride,
so as to meet him on the road, at the distance of a few miles
from the Castle; for, since his perilous situation with Lord
Elmwood, he was so fully convinced of the general philanthropy
of Sandford's character, that in spite of his churlish
manners, he now addressed him, free from that reserve to
which his rough behaviour had formerly given birth. And
Sandford, on his part, believing he had formed an illiberal
opinion of Lord Elmwood's heir, though he took no pains
to let him know that his opinion was changed, yet resolved
to make him restitution upon every occasion that offered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>Their mutual greetings when they met, were unceremonious,
but cordial; and Rushbrook turned his horse and
rode back with Sandford; yet, intimidated by his respect
and tenderness for Lady Matilda, rather than by fear of the
rebuffs of his companion, he had not the courage to name her,
till the ride was just finished, and they came within a few
yards of the house&mdash;incited then by the apprehension, he
might not soon again enjoy so fit an opportunity, he said,</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Sandford, if I guess where you have
been, and if my curiosity forces me to inquire for Miss Woodley's
and Lady Matilda's health?"</p>

<p>He named Miss Woodley first, to prolong the time before
he mentioned Matilda; for though to name her gave him
extreme pleasure, yet it was a pleasure accompanied by confusion
and pain.</p>

<p>"They are both very well," replied Sandford, "at least
they did not complain they were sick."</p>

<p>"They are not in spirits, I suppose?" said Rushbrook.</p>

<p>"No, indeed:" replied Sandford, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"No new misfortune has happened, I hope?" cried
Rushbrook; for it was plain to see Sandford's spirits were
unusually cast down.</p>

<p>"Nothing new," returned he, "except the insolence of
a young nobleman."</p>

<p>"What nobleman?" cried Rushbrook.</p>

<p>"A lover of Lady Matilda's," replied Sandford.</p>

<p>Rushbrook was petrified. "Who? What lover, Mr. Sandford?&mdash;explain?"</p>

<p>They were now arrived at the house; and Sandford, without
making any reply to this question, said to the servant
who took his horse, "She has come a long way this morning;
take care of her."</p>

<p>This interruption was torture to Rushbrook, who kept
close to his side, in order to obtain a further explanation; but
Sandford, without attending to him, walked negligently into
the hall, and before they advanced many steps, they were
met by Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>All further information was put an end to for the present.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Sandford?" said Lord Elmwood with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
extreme kindness; as if he thanked him for the journey
which, it was likely, he suspected he had been taking.</p>

<p>"I am indifferently well, my Lord:" replied he, with
a face of deep concern, and a tear in his eye, partly in gratitude
for his patron's civility, and partly in reproach for his
cruelty.</p>

<p>It was not now till the evening, that Rushbrook had an
opportunity of renewing the conversation, which had been
so barbarously interrupted.</p>

<p>In the evening, no longer able to support the suspense into
which he was thrown; without fear or shame, he followed
Sandford into his chamber at the time of his retiring, and
entreated of him, with all the anxiety he suffered, to explain
his allusion when he talked of a lover, and of insolence to
Lady Matilda.</p>

<p>Sandford, seeing his emotion, was angry with himself that
he had inadvertently mentioned the subject; and putting on
an air of surly importance, desired,&mdash;if he had any business
with him, that he would call in the morning.</p>

<p>Exasperated at so unexpected a reception, and at the pain
of his disappointment, Rushbrook replied, "He treated him
cruelly, nor would he stir out of his room, till he had received
a satisfactory answer to his question."</p>

<p>"Then bring your bed," replied Sandford, "for you must
pass your whole night here."</p>

<p>He found it vain to think of obtaining any intelligence
by threats, he therefore said in a timid and persuasive
manner,</p>

<p>"Did you, Mr. Sandford, hear Lady Matilda mention my
name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sandford, a little better reconciled to him.</p>

<p>"Did you tell her what I lately declared to you?" he
asked with still more diffidence.</p>

<p>"No," replied Sandford.</p>

<p>"It is very well, Sir," returned he, vexed to the heart&mdash;yet
again wishing to sooth him&mdash;</p>

<p>"You certainly, Mr. Sandford, know what is for the best&mdash;yet
I entreat you will give me some further account of
the nobleman you named?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what is for the best," replied Sandford, "and
I won't."</p>

<p>Rushbrook bowed, and immediately left the room. He
went apparently submissive, but the moment he showed this
submission, he took the resolution of paying a visit himself
to the farm at which Lady Matilda resided; and of learning,
either from Miss Woodley, the people of the house, the
neighbours, or perhaps from Lady Matilda's own lips, the
secret which the obstinacy of Sandford had with-held.</p>

<p>He saw all the dangers of this undertaking, but none
appeared so great as the danger of losing her he loved, by
the influence of a rival&mdash;and though Sandford had named
"insolence," he was in doubt whether what had appeared
so to him, was so in reality, or would be so considered by
her.</p>

<p>To prevent the cause of his absence being suspected by
Lord Elmwood, he immediately called his groom, ordered
his horse, and giving those servants concerned, a strict charge
of secrecy, with some frivolous pretence to apologize for his
not being present at breakfast (resolving to be back by
dinner) he set off that night, and arrived at an inn about
a mile from the farm at break of day.</p>

<p>The joy he felt when he found himself so near to the
beloved object of his journey, made him thank Sandford in
his heart, for the unkindness which had sent him thither.
But new difficulties arose, how to accomplish the end for
which he came; he learned from the people of the inn, that
a Lord, with a fine equipage, had visited at the farm, but who
he was, or for what purpose he went, no one could inform
him.</p>

<p>Dreading to return with his doubts unsatisfied, and yet
afraid of proceeding to extremities that might be construed
into presumption, he walked disconsolately (almost distractedly)
about the fields, looking repeatedly at his watch,
and wishing the time would stand still, till he was ready to
go back with his errand compleated.</p>

<p>Every field he passed, brought him nearer to the house
on which his imagination was fixed; but how, without
forfeiting every appearance of that respect which he so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
powerfully felt, could he attempt to enter it?&mdash;he saw the
indecorum, resolved not to be guilty of it, and yet walked on
till he was within but a small orchard of the door. Could he
then retreat?&mdash;he wished he could; but he found that he
had proceeded too far to be any longer master of himself.
The time was urgent; he must either behold her, and
venture her displeasure, or by diffidence during one moment,
give up all his hopes perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>With that same disregard to consequences, which actuated
him when he dared to supplicate Lord Elmwood in his
daughter's behalf, he at length went eagerly to the door and
rapped.</p>

<p>A servant came&mdash;he asked to "Speak with Miss Woodley,
if she was quite alone."</p>

<p>He was shown into an apartment, and Miss Woodley
entered to him.</p>

<p>She started when she beheld who it was; but as he did not
see a frown upon her face, he caught hold of her hand, and
said persuasively,</p>

<p>"Do not be offended with me. If I mean to offend you,
may I forfeit my life in atonement."</p>

<p>Poor Miss Woodley, glad in her solitude to see any one
from Elmwood House, forgot his visit was an offence, till he
put her in mind of it; she then said, with some reserve,</p>

<p>"Tell me the purport of your coming, Sir, and perhaps
I may have no reason to complain?"</p>

<p>"It was to see Lady Matilda," he replied, "or to hear of
her health. It was to offer her my services&mdash;it was, Miss
Woodley, to convince her, if possible, of my esteem."</p>

<p>"Had you no other method, Sir?" said Miss Woodley,
with the same reserve.</p>

<p>"None;" replied he, "or with joy I should have embraced
it; and if you can inform me of any other, tell me
I beseech you instantly, and I will immediately be gone,
and pursue your directions."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley hesitated.</p>

<p>"You know of no other means, Miss Woodley," he cried.</p>

<p>"And yet I cannot commend this," said she.</p>

<p>"Nor do I. Do not imagine because you see me here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
that I approve my conduct; but reduced to this necessity,
pity the motives that have urged it."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley did pity them; but as she would not own
that she did, she could think of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>At this instant a bell rung from the chamber above.</p>

<p>"That is Lady Matilda's bell," said Miss Woodley; "she
is coming to take a short walk. Do you wish to see her?"</p>

<p>Though it was the first wish of his heart, he paused, and
said, "Will you plead my excuse?"</p>

<p>As the flight of stairs was but short, which Matilda had to
come down, she was in the room with Miss Woodley and
Mr. Rushbrook, just as that sentence ended.</p>

<p>She had stepped beyond the door of the apartment, when
perceiving a visitor, she hastily withdrew.</p>

<p>Rushbrook, animated, though trembling at her presence,
cried, "Lady Matilda, do not avoid me, till you know that
I deserve such a punishment."</p>

<p>She immediately saw who it was, and returned back with
a proper pride, and yet a proper politeness in her manner.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir," said she, "I did not know you;
I was afraid I intruded upon Miss Woodley and a stranger."</p>

<p>"You do not then consider me as a stranger, Lady Matilda?
and that you do not, requires my warmest acknowledgements."</p>

<p>She sat down, as if overcome by ill spirits and ill health.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley now asked Rushbrook to sit&mdash;for till now
she had not.</p>

<p>"No, Madam," replied he, with confusion, "not unless
Lady Matilda gives me permission."</p>

<p>She smiled, and pointed to a chair&mdash;and all the kindness
which Rushbrook during his whole life had received from
Lord Elmwood, never inspired half the gratitude, which
this one instance of civility from his daughter excited.</p>

<p>He sat down, with the confession of the obligation upon
every feature of his face.</p>

<p>"I am not well, Mr. Rushbrook," said Matilda, languidly;
"and you must excuse any want of etiquette at this house."</p>

<p>"While you excuse me, Madam, what can I have to complain
of?"</p>

<p>She appeared absent while he was speaking, and turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to Miss Woodley, said, "Do you think I had better walk
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear," answered Miss Woodley; "the ground
is damp, and the air cold."</p>

<p>"You are not well, indeed, Lady Matilda," said Rushbrook,
gazing upon her with the most tender respect.</p>

<p>She shook her head; and the tears, without any effort
either to impel or to restrain them, ran down her face.</p>

<p>Rushbrook rose from his seat, and with an accent and
manner the most expressive, said, "We are cousins, Lady
Matilda&mdash;in our infancy we were brought up together&mdash;we
were beloved by the same mother&mdash;fostered by the same
father"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried she, interrupting him, with a tone which
indicated the bitterest anguish.</p>

<p>"Nay, do not let me add to your uneasiness," he resumed,
"while I am attempting to alleviate it. Instruct me what
I can do to show my esteem and respect, rather than permit
me thus unguided, to rush upon what you may construe into
insult and arrogance."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley went to Matilda, took her hand, then wiped
the tears from her eyes, while Matilda reclined against her,
entirely regardless of Rushbrook's presence.</p>

<p>"If I have been in the least instrumental to this sorrow,"&mdash;said
Rushbrook, with a face as much agitated as his mind.</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Woodley, in a low voice, "you have not&mdash;she
is often thus."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matilda, raising her head, "I am frequently
so weak that I cannot resist the smallest incitement to grief.
But do not make your visit long, Mr. Rushbrook," she continued,
"for I was just then thinking, that should Lord
Elmwood hear of this attention you have paid me, it might
be fatal to you." Here she wept again, as bitterly as before.</p>

<p>"There is no probability of his hearing of it, Madam,"
Rushbrook replied; "or if there was, I am persuaded that
he would not resent it; for yesterday, when I am confident
he knew that Mr. Sandford had been to see you, he received
him on his return, with unusual marks of kindness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he?" said she&mdash;and again she lifted up her head;
her eyes for a moment beaming with hope and joy.</p>

<p>"There is something which we cannot yet define," said
Rushbrook, "that Lord Elmwood struggles with; but when
time shall have eradicated"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Before he could proceed further, Matilda was once more
sunk into despondency, and scarce attended to what he was
saying.</p>

<p>Miss Woodley observing this, said, "Mr. Rushbrook, let
it be a token we shall be glad to see you hereafter, that I now
use the freedom to beg you will put an end to your visit."</p>

<p>"You send me away, Madam," returned he, "with the
warmest thanks for the reception you have give me; and
this last assurance of your kindness, is beyond any other
favour you could have bestowed. Lady Matilda," added he,
"suffer me to take your hand at parting, and let it be a
testimony that you acknowledge me for a relation."</p>

<p>She put out her hand&mdash;which he knelt to receive, but did
not raise it to his lips&mdash;he held the boon too sacred&mdash;and
looking earnestly upon it, as it lay pale and wan in his, he
breathed one sigh over it, and withdrew.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_CHAPTER_VII" id="IV_CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Sorrowful and affecting as this interview had been,
Rushbrook, as he rode home, reflected upon it with the most
inordinate delight; and had he not seen decline of health,
in the looks and behaviour of Lady Matilda, his felicity had
been unbounded. Entranced in the happiness of her society,
the thought of his rival never came once to his mind while
he was with her; a want of recollection, however, he by no
means regretted, as her whole appearance contradicted every
suspicion he could possibly entertain, that she favoured the
addresses of any man living&mdash;and had he remembered, he
would not have dared to name the subject.</p>

<p>The time ran so swiftly while he was away, that it was
beyond the dinner hour at Elmwood House, when he returned.
Heated, his dress and his hair disordered, he entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
dining room just as the dessert was put upon the table.
He was confounded at his own appearance, and at the falsehoods
he should be obliged to fabricate in his excuse: there
was yet, that which engaged his attention, beyond any circumstance
relating to himself&mdash;the features of Lord Elmwood&mdash;of
which his daughter's, whom he had just beheld,
had the most striking resemblance; though her's were
softened by sorrow, while his were made austere by the self-same
cause.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" said his uncle, with a frown.</p>

<p>"A hers chase, my Lord&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;but a pack
of dogs I unexpectedly met." For in the hacknied art of
lying without injury to any one, Rushbrook, to his shame,
was proficient.</p>

<p>His excuses were received, and the subject ceased.</p>

<p>During his absence that day, Lord Elmwood had called
Sandford apart, and said to him,&mdash;that as the malevolence
which he once observed between him and Rushbrook, had,
he perceived, subsided, he advised him, if he was a well-wisher
to the young man, to sound his heart, and counsel
him not to act against the will of his nearest relation and
friend. "I myself am too hasty," continued Lord Elmwood,
"and, unhappily, too much determined upon what
I have once (though, perhaps, rashly) said, to speak upon
a topic where it is probable I shall meet with opposition.
You, Sandford, can reason with moderation. For after all
that I have done for my nephew, it would be a pity to forsake
him at last; and yet, that is but too likely, if he provokes me."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Sandford, "I will speak to him."</p>

<p>"Yet," added Lord Elmwood, sternly, "do not urge what
you say for my sake, but for his&mdash;I can part from him with
ease&mdash;but he may then repent, and, you know, repentance
always comes too late with me."</p>

<p>"My Lord, I will exert all the efforts in my power for his
welfare. But what is the subject on which he has refused
to comply with your desires?"</p>

<p>"Matrimony&mdash;have not I told you?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"I wish him to marry, that I may then conclude the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
deeds in respect to my estate,&mdash;and the only child of Sir
William Winterton (a rich heiress) was the wife I meant to
propose; but from his indifference to all I have said on
the occasion, I have not yet mentioned her name to him;
you may."</p>

<p>"I will, my Lord, and use all my persuasion to engage his
obedience; and you shall have, at least, a faithful account
of what he says."</p>

<p>Sandford the next morning sought an opportunity of being
alone with Rushbrook&mdash;he then plainly repeated to him
what Lord Elmwood had said, and saw him listen to it all,
and heard him answer with the most tranquil resolution,
"That he would do any thing to preserve the friendship
and patronage of his uncle&mdash;but marry."</p>

<p>"What can be your reason?" asked Sandford&mdash;though
he guessed.</p>

<p>"A reason, I cannot give to Lord Elmwood."</p>

<p>"Then do not give it to me, for I have promised to tell
him every thing you say to me."</p>

<p>"And every thing I <i>have</i> said?" asked Rushbrook hastily.</p>

<p>"As to what you have said, I don't know whether it has
made impression enough on my memory, to enable me to
repeat it."</p>

<p>"I am glad it has not."</p>

<p>"And my answer to your uncle, is to be simply, that you
will not obey him?"</p>

<p>"I should hope, Mr. Sandford, that you would express it
in better terms."</p>

<p>"Tell me the terms, and I will be exact."</p>

<p>Rushbrook struck his forehead, and walked about the room.</p>

<p>"Am I to give him any reason for your disobeying him?"</p>

<p>"I tell you again, that I dare not name the cause."</p>

<p>"Then why do you submit to a power you are ashamed
to own?"</p>

<p>"I am not ashamed&mdash;I glory in it.&mdash;Are you ashamed of
your esteem for Lady Matilda?"</p>

<p>"Oh! if she is the cause of your disobedience, be assured
I shall not mention it, for I am forbid to name her."</p>

<p>"And surely, as that is the case, I need not fear to speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
plainly to you. I love Lady Matilda&mdash;or, perhaps, unacquainted
with love, what I feel may be only pity&mdash;and if so,
pity is the most pleasing passion that ever possessed a human
heart, and I would not change it for all her father's estates."</p>

<p>"Pity, then, gives rise to very different sensations&mdash;for
I pity you, and that sensation I would gladly exchange for
approbation."</p>

<p>"If you really feel compassion for me, and I believe you
do, contrive some means by your answers to Lord Elmwood
to pacify him, without involving me in ruin. Hint at my
affections being engaged, but not to whom; and add, that
I have given my word, if he will allow me a short time, a year
or two only, I will, during that period, try to disengage them,
and use all my power to render myself worthy of the union
for which he designs me."</p>

<p>"And this is not only your solemn promise&mdash;but your
fixed determination?"</p>

<p>"Nay, why will you search my heart to the bottom, when
the surface ought to content you?"</p>

<p>"If you cannot resolve on what you have proposed, why
do you ask this time of your uncle? For should he allow it
you, at the expiration, your disobedience to his commands
will be less pardonable than it is now."</p>

<p>"Within a year, Mr. Sandford, who can tell what strange
events may not occur, to change all our prospects? Even
my passion may decline."</p>

<p>"In that expectation, then&mdash;the failure of which yourself
must answer for&mdash;I will repeat as much of this discourse as
shall be proper."</p>

<p>Here Rushbrook communicated his having been to see
Lady Matilda, for which Sandford reproved him, but in less
rigorous terms than he generally used in his reproofs; and
Rushbrook, by his entreaties, now gained the intelligence
who the nobleman was who addressed Matilda, and on what
views; but was restrained to patience, by Sandford's arguments
and threats.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of this marriage, Sandford met his
patron, without having determined exactly what to say, but
rested on the temper in which he should find him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>At the commencement of the conversation he said, "Rushbrook
begged for time."</p>

<p>"I have given him time, have I not?" cried Lord Elmwood:
"What can be the meaning of his thus trifling
with me?"</p>

<p>Sandford replied, "My Lord, young men are frequently
romantic in their notions of love, and think it impossible to
have a sincere affection, where their own inclinations do not
first point out the choice."</p>

<p>"If he is in love," answered Lord Elmwood, "let him
take the object, and leave my house and me for ever. Nor
under this destiny can he have any claim to pity; for genuine
love will make him happy in banishment, in poverty, or in
sickness: it makes the poor man happy as the rich, the fool
blest as the wise." The sincerity with which Lord Elmwood
had loved, was expressed more than in words, as he said this.</p>

<p>"Your Lordship is talking," replied Sandford, "of the
passion in its most refined and predominant sense; while
I may possibly be speaking of a mere phantom, that has led
this young man astray."</p>

<p>"Whatever it be," returned Lord Elmwood, "let him and
his friends weigh the case well, and act for the best&mdash;so shall I."</p>

<p>"His friends, my Lord?&mdash;What friends, or what friend
has he upon earth but you?"</p>

<p>"Then why will he not submit to my advice; or himself
give me a proper reason why he cannot?"</p>

<p>"Because there may be friendship without familiarity&mdash;and
so it is between him and you."</p>

<p>"That cannot be; for I have condescended to talk to him
in the most familiar terms."</p>

<p>"To condescend, my Lord, is <i>not</i> to be familiar."</p>

<p>"Then come, Sir, let us be on an equal footing through
you. And now speak out <i>his</i> thoughts freely, and hear mine
in return."</p>

<p>"Why, then, he begs a respite for a year or two."</p>

<p>"On what pretence?"</p>

<p>"To me, it was preference of a single life&mdash;but I suspect
it is&mdash;what he imagines to be love&mdash;and for some object
whom he thinks your Lordship would disapprove."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has not, then, actually confessed this to you?"</p>

<p>"If he has, it was drawn from him by such means, that
I am not warranted to say it in direct words."</p>

<p>"I have entered into no contract, no agreement on his
account with the friends of the lady I have pointed out,"
said Lord Elmwood; "nothing beyond implications have
passed betwixt her family and myself at present; and if the
person on whom he has fixed his affections, should not be
in a situation absolutely contrary to my wishes, I may,
perhaps, confirm his choice."</p>

<p>That moment Sandford's courage prompted him to name
Lady Matilda, but his discretion opposed&mdash;however, in the
various changes of his countenance from the conflict, it was
plain to discern that he wished to say more than he dared.</p>

<p>On which Lord Elmwood cried,</p>

<p>"Speak on, Sandford&mdash;what are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Of you, my Lord."</p>

<p>He started.</p>

<p>Sandford went on&mdash;&mdash;"I know no tie&mdash;no bond&mdash;no
innocence, that is a protection when you feel resentment."</p>

<p>"You are right," he replied, significantly.</p>

<p>"Then how, my Lord, can you encourage me to <i>speak on</i>,
when that which I perhaps would say, might offend you to
hear?"</p>

<p>"To what, and whither are you changing our subject?"
cried Lord Elmwood. "But, Sir, if you know my resentful
and relentless temper, you surely know how to shun it."</p>

<p>"Not, and speak plainly."</p>

<p>"Then dissemble."</p>

<p>"No, I'll not do that&mdash;but I'll be silent."</p>

<p>"A new parade of submission. You are more tormenting
to me than any one I have about me. Constantly on the verge
of disobeying my commands, that you may recede, and gain
my good will by your forbearance. But know, Mr. Sandford,
that I will not suffer this much longer. If you chuse in every
conversation we have together (though the most remote
from such a subject) to think of my daughter, you must
either banish your thoughts, or conceal them&mdash;nor by one
sign, one item, remind me of her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your daughter did you call her? Can you call yourself
her father?"</p>

<p>"I do, Sir&mdash;but I was likewise the husband of her mother.
And, as that husband, I solemnly swear."&mdash;&mdash;He was proceeding
with violence.</p>

<p>"Oh! my Lord," cried Sandford, interrupting him, with
his hands clasped in the most fervent supplication&mdash;"Oh!
do not let me draw upon her one oath more of your eternal
displeasure&mdash;I'll kneel to beg that you will drop the subject."</p>

<p>The inclination he made with his knees bent towards the
ground, stopped Lord Elmwood instantly. But though it
broke in upon his words, it did not alter one angry look&mdash;his
eyes darted, and his lips trembled with, indignation.</p>

<p>Sandford, in order to appease him, bowed and offered to
withdraw, hoping to be recalled. He wished in vain&mdash;Lord
Elmwood's eyes followed him to the door, expressive of
rejoicing at his absence.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>The companions and counsellors of Lord Margrave, who
had so prudently advised gentle methods in the pursuit of
his passion, while there was left any hope of their success;
now, convinced there was none, as strenuously commended
open violence;&mdash;and sheltered under the consideration, that
their depredations were to be practised upon a defenceless
woman, who had not one protector, except an old priest,
the subject of their ridicule;&mdash;assured likewise from the
influence of Lord Margrave's wealth, that all inferior consequences
could be overborne, they saw no room for fears on
any side, and what they wished to execute, with care and
skill premeditated.</p>

<p>When their scheme was mature for performance, three of
his chosen companions, and three servants, trained in all the
villainous exploits of their masters, set off for the habitation
of poor Matilda, and arrived there about the twilight of the
evening.</p>

<p>Near four hours after that time (just as the family were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
going to bed) they came up to the doors of the house, and
rapping violently, gave the alarm of fire, conjuring all the
inhabitants to make their way out immediately, as they would
save their lives.</p>

<p>The family consisted of few persons, all of whom ran
instantly to the doors and opened them; on which two men
rushed in, and with the plea of saving Lady Matilda from
the pretended flames, caught her in their arms, and carried
her off; while all the deceived people of the house, running
eagerly to save themselves, paid no regard to her, till looking
for the cause for which they had been terrified, they perceived
the stratagem, and the fatal consequences.</p>

<p>Amidst the complaints, the sorrow, and the affright of the
people of the farm, Miss Woodley's sensations wanted a name&mdash;terror
and anguish give but a faint description of what she
suffered&mdash;something like the approach of death stole over
her senses, and she sat like one petrified with horror. She
had no doubt who was the perpetrator of this wickedness;
but how was she to follow? how effect a rescue?</p>

<p>The circumstances of this event, as soon as the people had
time to call up their recollection, were sent to a neighbouring
magistrate; but little could be hoped from that. Who was
to swear to the robber? Who, undertake to find him out!
Miss Woodley thought of Rushbrook, of Sandford, of Lord
Elmwood&mdash;but what could she hope from the want of power
in the two former?&mdash;what from the latter, for the want of
will? Now stupified, and now distracted, she walked about
the house incessantly, begging for instructions how to act,
or how to forget her misery.</p>

<p>A tenant of Lord Elmwood's, who occupied a little farm
near to that where Lady Matilda lived, and who was well
acquainted with the whole history of her's and her mother's
misfortunes, was returning from a neighbouring fair, just as
this inhuman plan was put in execution. He heard the cries
of a woman in distress, and followed the sound, till he arrived
at a chaise in waiting, and saw Matilda placed in it, by the
side of two men, who presented pistols to him, as he offered
to approach and expostulate.</p>

<p>The farmer, uncertain who this female was, yet went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the house she had been taken from (as the nearest) with the
tale of what he had seen; and there, being informed it was
Lady Matilda whom he had beheld, this intelligence, joined
to the powerful effect her screams had on him, made him
resolve to take horse immediately, and with some friends,
follow the carriage till they should trace the place to which
she was conveyed.</p>

<p>The anxiety, the firmness discovered in determining on
this understanding, somewhat alleviated the agony Miss
Woodley endured, and she began to hope, timely assistance
might yet be given to her beloved charge.</p>

<p>The man set out, meaning at all events to attempt her
release; but before he had proceeded far, the few friends
that accompanied him, began to reflect on the improbability
of their success, against a nobleman, surrounded by servants,
with other attendants likewise, and, perhaps, even countenanced
by the father of the lady, whom they presumed to
take from him; or if not, while Lord Elmwood beheld the
offence with indifference, that indifference gave it a sanction,
they might in vain oppose. These cool reflections tending
to their safety, had their weight with the companions of the
farmer; they all rode back, rejoicing at their second thoughts,
and left him to pursue his journey and prove his valour by
himself.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>It was not with Sandford, as it had lately been with Rushbrook
under the displeasure of Lord Elmwood&mdash;to the latter
he behaved, as soon as their dissension was past, as if it had
never happened&mdash;but to Sandford it was otherwise&mdash;the
resentment which he had repressed at the time of the offence,
lurked in his heart, and dwelt upon his mind for several
days; during which, he carefully avoided exchanging a
word with him, and gave every other demonstration of
his anger.</p>

<p>Sandford, though experienced in the cruelty and ingratitude
of the world, yet could not without difficulty brook
this severity, this contumely, from a man, for whose welfare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
ever since his infancy, he had laboured; and whose happiness
was more dear to him, in spite of all his faults, than that of
any other person. Even Lady Matilda was not so dear to
Sandford as her father&mdash;and he loved her more that she was
Lord Elmwood's child, than for any other cause.</p>

<p>Sometimes the old Priest, incensed beyond bearing, was on
the point of saying to his patron, "How, in my age, dare you
thus treat the man, whom in his youth you respected and
revered?"</p>

<p>Sometimes instead of anger, he felt the tear, he was
ashamed to own, steal to his eye, and even fall down his
cheek. Sometimes he left the room half determined to leave
the house&mdash;but these were all half determinations; for he
knew him with whom he had to deal too well, not to know
that he might be provoked into yet greater anger; and that
should he once rashly quit his house, the doors most probably
would be shut against him for ever.</p>

<p>In this humiliating state (for even many of the domestics
could not but observe their Lord's displeasure) Sandford
passed three days, and was beginning the fourth, when sitting
with Lord Elmwood and Rushbrook just after breakfast,
a servant entered, saying, as he opened the door, to somebody
who followed, "You must wait till you have my Lord's
permission."</p>

<p>This attracted their eyes to the door, and a man meanly
dressed, walked in, following close to the servant.</p>

<p>The latter turned, and seemed again to desire the person
to retire, but in vain; he rushed forward regardless of his
opposer, and in great agitation, cried,</p>

<p>"My Lord, if you please, I have business with you, provided
you will chuse to be alone."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood, struck with the intruder's earnestness,
bade the servant leave the room; and then said to the
stranger,</p>

<p>"You may speak before these gentlemen."</p>

<p>The man instantly turned pale, and trembled&mdash;then, to
prolong the time before he spoke, went to the door to see if
it was shut&mdash;returned&mdash;yet still trembling, seemed unwilling
to say his errand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have you done," cried Lord Elmwood, "that you
are in this terror? What have you done, man?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my Lord," replied he, "but I am afraid I am
going to offend you."</p>

<p>"Well, no matter;" (he answered carelessly) "only go on,
and let me know your business."</p>

<p>The man's distress increased&mdash;and he cried in a voice of
grief and affright&mdash;"Your child, my Lord!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Rushbrook and Sandford started; and looking at Lord
Elmwood, saw him turn white as death. In a tremulous
voice he instantly cried,</p>

<p>"What of her?" and rose from his seat.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the question, and the agitation of him who
asked it, the poor man gave way to his feelings, and answered
with every sign of sorrow,</p>

<p>"I saw her, my Lord, taken away by force&mdash;two ruffians
seized and carried her away, while she screamed in vain to
me for help, and tore her hair in distraction."</p>

<p>"Man, what do you mean?" cried the Earl.</p>

<p>"Lord Margrave," replied the stranger, "we have no
doubt, has formed this plot&mdash;he has for some time past beset
the house where she lived; and when his visits were refused,
he threatened this. Besides, one of his servants attended
the carriage; I saw, and knew him."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood listened to the last part of this account
with seeming composure&mdash;then turning hastily to Rushbrook,
he said,</p>

<p>"Where are my pistols, Harry?"</p>

<p>Sandford rose from his seat, and forgetting all the anger
between them, caught hold of the Earl's hand, and cried,
"Will you then prove yourself a father?"</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood only answered, "Yes," and left the room.</p>

<p>Rushbrook followed, and begged with all the earnestness
he felt, to be permitted to accompany his uncle.</p>

<p>While Sandford shook hands with the farmer a thousand
times; and he, in his turn, rejoiced, as if he had already seen
Lady Matilda restored to liberty.</p>

<p>Rushbrook in vain entreated Lord Elmwood; he laid his
commands upon him not to go a step from the Castle; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the agitation of his own mind, was too great, to observe the
rigour of this sentence on his nephew.</p>

<p>During the hasty preparations for the Earl's departure,
Sandford received from Miss Woodley the sad intelligence
of what had happened; but he returned an answer to recompence
her for all she had suffered on the occasion.</p>

<p>Within a few hours Lord Elmwood set off, accompanied by
his guide, the farmer, and other attendants furnished with
every requisite to ascertain the success of their enterprise&mdash;while
poor Matilda little thought of a deliverer nigh, much
less, that her deliverer should prove her father.</p>



<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h2><a name="IV_CHAPTER_X" id="IV_CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Lord Margrave, black as this incident of his life must
make him appear to the reader, still nursed in his conscience
a reserve of specious virtue, to keep him in peace with himself.
It was his design to plead, to argue, to implore, nay
even to threaten, long before he put his threats in force;
and with this and the following reflection, he reconciled&mdash;as
most bad men can&mdash;what he had done, not only to the
laws of humanity, but to the laws of honour.</p>

<p>"I have stolen a woman certainly;" said he to himself,
"but I will make her happier than she was in that humble
state from which I have taken her. I will even," said he,
"now that she is in my power, win her affections&mdash;and
when, in fondness, hereafter she hangs upon me, how will
she thank me for this little trial, through which I shall have
conducted her to happiness!"</p>

<p>Thus did he hush his remorse, while he waited impatiently
at home, in expectation of his prize.</p>

<p>Half expiring with her sufferings, of body as well as of
mind, about twelve o'clock the next night, after she was borne
away, Matilda arrived; and felt her spirits revive by the
superior sufferings that awaited her&mdash;for her increasing
terrors roused her from the death-like weakness, brought on
by fatigue.</p>

<p>Lord Margrave's house, to which he had gone previous to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
this occasion, was situated in the lonely part of a well-known
forest, not more than twenty miles distant from London:
this was an estate he rarely visited; and as he had but few
servants here, it was a place which he supposed would be
less the object of suspicion in the present case, than any other
of his seats. To this, then, Lady Matilda was conveyed&mdash;a
superb apartment allotted her&mdash;and one of his confidential
females placed to attend upon her, with all respect, and
assurances of safety.</p>

<p>Matilda looked in this woman's face, and seeing she bore
the features of her sex, while her own knowledge reached
none of those worthless characters of which this person was
a specimen, she imagined that none of those could look as
she did, and therefore found consolation in her seeming
tenderness. She was even prevailed upon (by her promises
to sit by her side and watch) to throw herself on the bed,
and suffer sleep for a few minutes&mdash;for sleep to her was
suffering; her fears giving birth to dreams terrifying as her
waking thoughts.</p>

<p>More wearied than refreshed with her sleep, she rose at
break of day, and refusing to admit of the change of an
article in her dress, she persisted to sit in the torn disordered
habit in which she had been dragged away; nor would she
taste a morsel, of all the delicacies that were prepared for her.</p>

<p>Her attendant, for some time observed the most reverential
awe; but finding this had not the effect of gaining compliance
with her advice, she varied her manners, and began by
less submissive means to attempt an influence. She said her
orders were to be obedient, while she herself was obeyed&mdash;at
least in circumstances so material as the lady's health, of
which she had the charge as a physician, and expected equal
compliance from her patient&mdash;food and fresh apparel she
prescribed as the only means to prevent death; and even
threatened her invalid with something worse, a visit from
Lord Margrave, if she continued obstinate.</p>

<p>Now loathing her for the deception she had practised,
more, than had she received her thus at first, Matilda hid
her eyes from the sight of her; and when she was obliged
to look, she shuddered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>This female at length thought it her duty to wait upon her
worthy employer, and inform him the young lady in her
trust would certainly die, unless there were means employed
to oblige her to take some nourishment.</p>

<p>Lord Margrave, glad of an opportunity that might apologize
for his intrusion upon Lady Matilda, went with eagerness
to her apartment, and throwing himself at her feet,
conjured her if she would save his life, as well as her own,
to submit to be consoled.</p>

<p>The extreme disgust and horror his presence inspired,
caused Matilda for a moment to forget all her want of power,
her want of health, her weakness; and rising from the place
where she sat, she cried, with her voice elevated,</p>

<p>"Leave me, my Lord, or I'll die in spite of all your care;
I'll instantly expire with grief, if you do not leave me."</p>

<p>Accustomed to the tears and reproaches of the sex&mdash;though
not of those like her&mdash;he treated with contempt these
menaces of anger, and seizing her hand, carried it to his lips.</p>

<p>Enraged, and overwhelmed with sorrow at the affront, she
cried, (forgetting every other friend she had,) "Oh! my dear
Miss Woodley, why are you not here to protect me?"</p>

<p>"Nay," returned Lord Margrave, stifling a fit of laughter,
"I should think the old Priest would be as good a champion
as the lady."</p>

<p>The remembrance of Sandford, with all his kindness, now
rushed so forcibly on Matilda's mind, that she shed a shower
of tears, on thinking how much he felt, and would continue
to feel, for her situation. Once she thought on Rushbrook,
and thought even <i>he</i> would be sorry for her. Of her father
she did not think&mdash;she dared not&mdash;one single moment that
thought intruded, but she hurried it away&mdash;it was too bitter.</p>

<p>It was now again quite night; and near to that hour when
she came first to the house. Lord Margrave, though at some
distance from her, remained still in her apartment, while her
female companion had stolen away. His insensibility to her
lamentations&mdash;the agitated looks he sometimes cast upon
her&mdash;her weak and defenceless state, all conspired to fill her
mind with horror.</p>

<p>He saw her apprehensions in her distracted face, disheveled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
hair, and the whole of her forlorn appearance&mdash;yet, notwithstanding
his former resolutions, he could not resist the desire
of fulfilling all her dreadful expectations.</p>

<p>He once again approached her, and again was going to
seize her hand; when the report of a pistol, and a confused
noise of persons assembling towards the apartment prevented
him.</p>

<p>He started&mdash;but looked more surprised than alarmed&mdash;her
alarm was augmented; for she supposed this tumult was
some experiment to intimidate her into submission. She
wrung her hands, and lifted up her eyes to Heaven, in the
last agony of despair, when one of Lord Margrave's servants
entered hastily and announced,</p>

<p>"Lord Elmwood!"</p>

<p>That moment her father entered&mdash;and with all the unrestrained
fondness of a parent, folded her in his arms.</p>

<p>Her extreme, her excess of joy on such a meeting, and
from such anguish rescued, was, in part, repressed by his
awful presence. The apprehensions to which she had been
accustomed, kept her timid and doubtful&mdash;she feared to
speak, or clasp him in return for his embrace, but falling on
her knees, clung round his legs, and bathed his feet with her
tears.&mdash;&mdash;These were the happiest moments that she had
ever known&mdash;perhaps, the happiest <i>he</i> had ever known.</p>

<p>Lord Margrave, on whom Lord Elmwood had not even cast
a look, now left the room; but as he quitted it, called out,</p>

<p>"My Lord Elmwood, if you have any demands on me,"&mdash;</p>

<p>The Earl interrupted him, "Would you make me an
executioner? The law shall be your only antagonist."</p>

<p>Matilda, quite exhausted, yet upheld by the sudden
transport she had felt, was led by her father out of this
wretched dwelling&mdash;more despicable than the beggar's hovel.</p>

<p>Overcome with the want of rest for two nights, from her
distracting fears, and all those fears now hushed; Matilda,
soon after she was placed in the carriage with Lord Elmwood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
dropped fast asleep; and thus, insensibly surprised, leaned
her head against her father in the sweetest slumber that
imagination can conceive.</p>

<p>When she awoke, instead of the usual melancholy scene
before her view, she beheld her father, and heard the voice
of the once dreaded Lord Elmwood tenderly saying,</p>

<p>"We will go no further to-night, the fatigue is too much
for her; order beds here directly, and some proper person
to sit up and attend her."</p>

<p>She could only turn to him with a look of love and duty;
her lips could not utter a sentence.</p>

<p>In the morning she found her father by the side of her
bed. He inquired "If she was in health sufficient to pursue
her journey, or if she would remain where she was?"</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> able to go with you," she answered instantly.</p>

<p>"Nay," replied he, "perhaps you ought to stay here till
you are better?"</p>

<p>"I am better," said she, "and ready to go with you."&mdash;&mdash;Half
afraid that he meant to send her from him.</p>

<p>He perceived her fears, and replied, "Nay, if you stay, so
shall I&mdash;and when I go, I shall take you along with me to my
house."</p>

<p>"To Elmwood House?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, to my house in town, where I intend to be all the
winter, and where we shall live together."</p>

<p>She turned her face on the pillow to conceal tears of joy,
but her sobs revealed them.</p>

<p>"Come," said he, "this kiss is a token you have nothing
to fear." And he kissed her affectionately. "I shall send
for Miss Woodley too immediately," continued he.</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall be overjoyed to see her, my Lord&mdash;and to
see Mr. Sandford&mdash;and even Mr. Rushbrook."</p>

<p>"Do you know <i>him</i>?" said Lord Elmwood.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "I have seen him two or three times."</p>

<p>The Earl hoping the air might be a means of re-establishing
her strength and spirits, now left the room, and ordered his
carriage to be prepared: while she arose, attended by one
of his female servants, for whom he had sent to town, to
bring such changes of apparel as were requisite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>When Matilda was ready to join her father in the next
room, she felt a tremor seize her, that made it almost impossible
to appear before him. No other circumstance now
impending to agitate her heart, she felt more forcibly its
embarrassment at meeting on terms of easy intercourse, him,
of whom she had never been used to think, but with that
distant reverence and fear, which his severity had excited;
and she knew not how she should dare to speak to, or look on
him, with that freedom her affection warranted.</p>

<p>After several efforts to conquer these nice and refined
sensations, but to no purpose, she at last went to his apartment.
He was reading; but as she entered, he put out his
hand and drew her to him. Her tears wholly overcame her.
He could have intermingled his&mdash;but assuming a grave
countenance, he commanded her to desist from exhausting
her spirits; and, after a few powerful struggles, she obeyed.</p>

<p>Before the morning was over, she experienced the extreme
joy of sitting by her father's side as they drove to town, and
of receiving, during his conversation, a thousand proofs of
his love, and tokens of her lasting happiness.</p>

<p>It was now the middle of November; and yet, as Matilda
passed along, never to her, did the sun shine so bright as
upon this morning&mdash;never did her imagination comprehend,
that the human heart could feel happiness true and genuine
as hers!</p>

<p>On arriving at the house, there was no abatement of her
felicity: all was respect and duty on the part of the domestics&mdash;all
paternal care on the part of Lord Elmwood; and she
would have been at that summit of her wishes which annihilates
hope, but that the prospect of seeing Miss Woodley
and Mr. Sandford, still kept this passion in existence.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Top</a></span>

<p>Rushbrook was detained at Elmwood House during all
this time, more from the persuasions, nay prayers, of Sandford,
than the commands of Lord Elmwood. He had, but
for Sandford, followed his uncle, and exposed himself to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
anger, sooner than have endured the most piercing inquietude,
which he was doomed to suffer, till the news
arrived of Lady Matilda's safety. He indeed had little else
to fear from the known firm, courageous character of her
father, and the expedition with which he undertook his
journey; but lovers' fears are like those of women, obstinate,
and no argument could persuade either him or Miss Woodley
(who had now ventured to come to Elmwood House) but
that Matilda's peace of mind might be for ever destroyed,
before she was set at liberty.</p>

<p>The summons from Lord Elmwood for their coming to
town, was received by each of this party with delight; but
the impatience to obey it, was in Rushbrook so violent, it
was painful to himself, and extremely troublesome to Sandford;
who wished, from his regard to Lady Matilda, rather
to delay, than hurry their journey.</p>

<p>"You are to blame," said he to him and Miss Woodley,
"to wish by your arrival, to divide with Lord Elmwood
that tender bond, which ties the good who confer obligations,
to the object of their benevolence. At present there
is no one with him to share in the care and protection of
his daughter, and he is under the necessity of discharging
that duty himself; this habit may become so powerful, that
he <i>cannot</i> throw it off, even if his former resolutions should
urge him to it. While we remain here, therefore, Lady
Matilda is safe with her father; but it would not surprise
me, if on our arrival (especially if we are precipitate) he
should place her again with Miss Woodley at a distance."</p>

<p>To this forcible conjecture, they submitted for a few days,
and then most gladly set out for town.</p>

<p>On their arrival, they were met, even at the street-door,
by Lady Matilda; and with an expression of joy, they did not
suppose her features could have worn. She embraced Miss
Woodley! hung upon Sandford! and to Mr. Rushbrook,
who from his conscious love only bowed at an humble
distance, she held out her hand with every look and gesture
of the tenderest esteem.</p>

<p>When Lord Elmwood joined them, he welcomed them
all sincerely; but Sandford the most, with whom he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
spoken for many days before he left the country, for his
allusion to the wretched situation of his daughter.&mdash;And
Sandford (with his fellow-travellers) now saw him treat that
daughter with an easy, a natural fondness, as if she had lived
with him from her infancy. He appeared, however, at times,
under the apprehension, that the propensity of man to
jealousy, might give Rushbrook a pang at this dangerous
rival in his love and fortune&mdash;for though Lord Elmwood
remembered well the hazard he had once ventured to befriend
Matilda, yet the present unlimited reconciliation was
something so unlooked for, it might be a trial too much for his
generosity, to remain wholly disinterested on the event.
Slight as was this suspicion, it did Rushbrook injustice. He
loved Lady Matilda too sincerely, he loved her father's
happiness, and her mother's memory too faithfully, not to
be rejoiced at all he witnessed; nor could the secret hope
that whispered him, "Their blessings might one day be
mutual," increase the pleasure he found, in beholding
Matilda happy.</p>

<p>Unexpected affairs, in which Lord Elmwood had been for
some time engaged, had diverted his attention for awhile
from the marriage of his nephew; nor did he at this time
find his disposition sufficiently severe, to exact from the young
man a compliance with his wishes, at so cruel an alternative
as that of being for ever discarded. He felt his mind, by the
late incident, too much softened for such harshness; he yet
wished for the alliance he had proposed; for he was more
consistent in his character than to suffer the tenderness his
daughter's peril had awakened, to derange those plans which
he had long projected. Never even now, for a moment did
he indulge&mdash;for perhaps it would have been an indulgence&mdash;the
idea of replacing her exactly in the rights of her birth, to
the disappointment of all his nephew's expectations.</p>

<p>Yet, milder at this crisis in his temper than he had been
for years before, and knowing he could be no longer irritated
upon the subject of his daughter, he once more resolved to
trust himself in a conference with Rushbrook on the subject
of marriage; meaning at the same time to mention Matilda
as an opponent from whom he had nothing to fear. But for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
some time before Rushbrook was called to this private
audience, he had, by his unwearied attention, endeavoured
to impress upon Matilda's mind, the softest sentiments in
his favour. He succeeded&mdash;but not as he wished. She loved
him as her friend, her cousin, her foster-brother, but not as
a lover. The idea of love never once came to her thoughts;
and she would sport with Rushbrook like the most harmless
child, while he, all impassioned, could with difficulty resist
telling her, what she made him suffer.</p>

<p>At the meeting between him and Lord Elmwood, to which
he was called for his final answer on that subject which had
once nearly proved so fatal to him; after a thousand fears,
much confusion and embarrassment, he at length frankly
confessed his "Heart was engaged, and had been so, long
before his uncle offered to direct his choice."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood desired to know, "On whom he had
placed his affections."</p>

<p>"I dare not tell you, my Lord," returned he, infinitely
confused; "but Mr. Sandford can witness their sincerity
and how long they have been fixed."</p>

<p>"Fixed!" cried the Earl.</p>

<p>"Immoveably fixed, my Lord; and yet the object is as
unconscious of my love to this moment, as you yourself have
been; and I swear ever shall be so, without your permission."</p>

<p>"Name the object," said Lord Elmwood, anxiously.</p>

<p>"My Lord, I dare not.&mdash;The last time I named her to you,
you threatened to abandon me for my arrogance."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood started.&mdash;&mdash;"My daughter! Would you
marry her?"</p>

<p>"But with your approbation, my Lord; and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he could proceed a word further, his uncle left the
room hastily&mdash;and left Rushbrook all terror for his approaching
fate.</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood went immediately into the apartment
where Sandford, Miss Woodley, and Matilda, were sitting,
and cried with an angry voice, and with his countenance
disordered,</p>

<p>"Rushbrook has offended me beyond forgiveness.&mdash;Go,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Sandford, to the library, where he is, and tell him this
instant to quit my house, and never dare to return."</p>

<p>Miss Woodley lifted up her hands and sighed.</p>

<p>Sandford rose slowly from his seat to execute the office.</p>

<p>While Lady Matilda, who was arranging her music books
upon the instrument, stopped from her employment suddenly,
with her face bathed in tears.</p>

<p>A general silence ensued, till Lord Elmwood, resuming
his angry tone, cried, "Did you hear me, Mr. Sandford?"</p>

<p>Sandford now, without a word in reply, made for the door&mdash;but
there Matilda impeded him, and throwing her arms
about his neck, cried,</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Sandford, do not."</p>

<p>"How!" exclaimed her father.</p>

<p>She saw the impending frown, and rushing towards him,
took his hand fearfully, and knelt at his feet. "Mr. Rushbrook
is my relation," she cried in a pathetic voice, "my
companion, my friend&mdash;before you loved me he was anxious
for my happiness, and often visited me to lament with, and
console me. I cannot see him turned out of your house
without feeling for <i>him</i>, what he once felt for <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Lord Elmwood turned aside to conceal his sensations&mdash;then
raising her from the floor, he said, "Do you know
what he has asked of me?"</p>

<p>"No," answered she in the utmost ignorance, and with
the utmost innocence painted on her face; "but whatever
it is, my Lord, though you do not grant it, yet pardon him
for asking."</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>you</i> would grant him what he has requested?"
said her father.</p>

<p>"Most willingly&mdash;was it in my gift."</p>

<p>"It is," replied he. "Go to him in the library, and hear
what he has to say; for on your will his fate shall depend."</p>

<p>Like lightning she flew out of the room; while even the
grave Sandford smiled at the idea of their meeting.</p>

<p>Rushbrook, with his fears all verified by the manner in
which his uncle had left him, sat with his head reclined
against a bookcase, and every limb extended with the despair
that had seized him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>Matilda nimbly opened the door and cried, "Mr. Rushbrook,
I am come to comfort you."</p>

<p>"That you have always done," said he, rising in rapture to
receive her, even in the midst of all his sadness.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" said she. "What have you asked
of my father that he has denied you?"</p>

<p>"I have asked for that," replied he, "which is dearer to
me than my life."</p>

<p>"Be satisfied then," returned she, "for you shall have it."</p>

<p>"Dear Matilda! it is not in your power to bestow."</p>

<p>"But he has told me it <i>shall</i> be in my power; and has
desired me to give, or to refuse it you, at my own pleasure."</p>

<p>"O Heavens!" cried Rushbrook in transport, "Has he?"</p>

<p>"He has indeed&mdash;before Mr. Sandford and Miss Woodley.
Now tell me what you petitioned for?"</p>

<p>"I asked him," cried Rushbrook, trembling, "for a wife."</p>

<p>Her hand, which had just then taken hold of his, in the
warmth of her wish to serve him, now dropped down as with
the stroke of death&mdash;her face lost its colour&mdash;and she leaned
against the desk by which they were standing, without
uttering a word.</p>

<p>"What means this change?" said he; "Do you not wish
me happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she exclaimed: "Heaven is my witness. But it
gives me concern to think we must part."</p>

<p>"Then let us be joined," cried he, falling at her feet, "till
death alone can part us."</p>

<p>All the sensibility&mdash;the reserve&mdash;the pride, with which she
was so amply possessed, returned to her that moment. She
started and cried, "Could Lord Elmwood know for what he
sent me?"</p>

<p>"He did," replied Rushbrook&mdash;"I boldly told him of my
presumptuous love, and he has given to you alone, the power
over my happiness or misery. Oh! do not doom me to the
latter."</p>

<p>Whether the heart of Matilda, such as it has been described,
<i>could</i> sentence him to misery, the reader is left to surmise&mdash;and
if he supposes that it could <i>not</i>, he has every reason to
suppose that their wedded life, was&mdash;a life of happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>He has beheld the pernicious effects of an <i>improper education</i>
in the destiny which attended the unthinking Miss
Milner.&mdash;On the opposite side, what may not be hoped from
that school of prudence&mdash;though of adversity&mdash;in which
Matilda was bred?</p>

<p>And Mr. Milner, Matilda's grandfather, had better have
given his <i>fortune</i> to a distant branch of his family&mdash;as Matilda's
father once meant to do&mdash;so that he had given to his daughter</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
