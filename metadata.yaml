description: "A Simple Story is a novel by English author and actress, Elizabeth Inchbald.\
  \ Published in early 1791 as an early example of a \"novel of passion\", it was\
  \ very successful and became widely read in England and abroad. It went into a second\
  \ edition in March 1791. It is still in print today.\nThe novel is divided into\
  \ four books, two each devoted to its two storylines. The first two books follow\
  \ the love story of young Miss Milner (we are never told her first name) and her\
  \ guardian Dorriforth, a Roman Catholic priest, who later renounces his holy orders\
  \ on inheriting an aristocratic title and marries Miss Milner. The last two books,\
  \ set some seventeen or eighteen years later, follow the troubled relationship of\
  \ Dorriforth (now Lord Elmwood) and his daughter Matilda, whom he has excluded from\
  \ his life following his wife's adulterous affair and death.\nThe book touches on\
  \ issues including the education of women, Catholicism, sensibility, and gender\
  \ roles.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
